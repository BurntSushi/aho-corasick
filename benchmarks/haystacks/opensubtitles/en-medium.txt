Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right.
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- # You can't get far without a railroad #
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Come to me, I pray
# I miss you more each day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Bring back the great love
# The love that once we knew
# Make my dreams come true
# The dream I had with you
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
(Man) I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
(# Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(# Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
# I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
# So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
# And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
# But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
# That you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad #
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(# Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes.
