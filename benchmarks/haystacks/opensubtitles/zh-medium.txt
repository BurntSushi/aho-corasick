但是他有些問題 But there was something about him
所以她告訴我 他們要訂婚的時 我反對了 so when she said they were engaged I told her I was against it
但是不愧是我的女兒 於是 but being my daughter, naturally
她還是和他結婚了 she went ahead and married him anyway.
不用說 她沒有邀請我參加他們的婚禮 Needless to say, I wasn't invited to the wedding.
你肯定很傷心 That must have hurt.
你這麼認為 You think?
他第一次打她 她來找我 First time he hit her, she came to me.
我想打爆他的頭 I wanted to bash his brains in.
她阻止了我 She wouldn't let me.
說她愛他 這不是他的錯 他只是喝了點酒 Said she loved him, said it wasn't his fault, he'd had a few drinks
是她先惹他的 she was the one picked the fight.
他第二次打她時 她沒有來找我 Next time it happened, she didn't come to me.

我不知道他說了什麼 做了什麼 I don't know what he said, don't know what he did
我只知道他沒有殺他 all I know is he didn't kill him
我女兒從此再沒有他的消息了 and my daughter never heard from him again.
她怎麼反應的 How did she react?
你無法相信他直呼我的名字 更糟的是 Called me names you wouldn't believe, and worse
她說對她而言我已經死了 Said I was dead to her.
我不為我所做的事情感到驕傲 I'm not proud of everything I did
但是我很肯定 要是能重來 我仍會那麼做 but I'm pretty sure I'd do it all again
如果他們因為我女兒恨我 so if they don't let me into egyptian heaven
而不讓我進入埃及的天堂 because my daughter hates me
我猜他們確實會這麼做 well, then I guess that's just the way it goes.
不管怎麼說 算是回答了你的兩個問題 However you answer your two questions.

安排葬禮讓我很苦惱 Funeral plans tend to confuse me.
確切的說 是土葬好還是火葬好 Specifically, buried or cremated.
土葬吧 Take buried.
雖然我知道這無關緊要 但是我有幽閉恐懼癥 Now, I know it shouldn't matter, but I'm claustrophobic.
如果哪天我在地下突然醒了 沒有人聽到怎麼辦 What if I wake up underground and nobody can hear me?
他們還會生產那種內置鈴鐺的棺材嗎 Do they still make those coffins with the bells?
嗯...
我估計沒有了 Uh...
I don't believe they do.
那火葬吧 你打算怎麼處理那些骨灰呢?
Then cremated.
what do you do with the ashes?
把他們埋了還是撒了?
把他們放到架子上?
Do you bury them, scatter them, put them on a shelf?
扔進恆河順流而下找個安樂窩?
Float them down the ganges on a bed of flowers?
如果我感覺到火焰怎麼辦 What if I feel the flames?
但是我確定我會火葬 Well, I definitely want to have myself cremated.
也許我們應該像華特.
迪斯尼一樣把自己冷凍起來 Maybe we should go frozen like walt disney.
不好 還是火葬吧 No.
cremated.
把骨灰放到鐵罐裡 埋到風景秀麗的地方 Ashes put in a can, buried some place with a view.
鐵罐 嗯?
A can, huh?
是的 我不喜歡骨灰盒的說法 Yeah.
I never liked the sound of the word urn.
是嗎 難道你對地穴有特殊的感覺?
Really?
got any special feelings about crypt?
