Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right.
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- # You can't get far without a railroad #
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Come to me, I pray
# I miss you more each day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Sometimes I feel like I could jump over the moon
# And tell the sky above
# Does it matter how full the moon
# When you've an empty heart
# Bring back the great love
# The love that once we knew
# Make my dreams come true
# The dream I had with you
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
(Man) I'd better get back to work.
Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their railroad.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the railroad.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
(# Folk tune)
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your railroad.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a railroad.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
(# Lively jig)
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
Up Garryowen!
# I was farming in Missouri I was getting tired of that
# So I bought myself a satchel and a stovepipe hat
# And I headed for the station gonna travel all about
# But there wasn't any station and I soon found out
# That you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# Oh, you can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad #
I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music, Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
(Groaning)
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
(Woman screams)
(Groaning)
(Stops playing)
(Shouting)
(Screaming)
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
(Woman screeches)
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- (Woman) Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the railroad to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
- First I was.
- Uh-huh.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the railroad ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
Uh-huh.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine short cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
- I think you're real pretty.
- Ah!
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the railroad.
I guess a lot of people follow the railroad.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the railroad again?
- If I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the railroad and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
(Pete) Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
(Train rattling)
(Train whistle)
(Knocking)
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda short on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the railroad.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- (Woman) Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the railroad again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about railroad payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
Uh-uh.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
(Verna) Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a railroad.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a railroad if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
(Train whistle)
- Ma'am, is that all?
- Mm-hm.
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
(Clunking)
(Train whistle)
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What colour horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
(Train chugging)
(Train whistle)
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 aging yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Travelling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
(Discordant notes)
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
(# Folk tune)
- Been up here before?
- Part way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- (Man) Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build railroads how to get through the mountains?
- The river.
- Huh?
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
# Follow the river
# The river knows the way
# Hearts can go astray
# It happens every day
# Follow the river
# Wherever you may be
# Follow the river back to me #
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
(Train whistle)
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy travelling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
(Clanking)
(Horse whinnies)
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
(Laughs) You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
(Laughs) It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!
# So I bought myself a shovel and I bought myself a pick
# And I laid a little track along the bullfrog crick
# Then I built a locomotive out of 20 empty cans
# And I tooted on the whistle and the darned thing ran
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# Something's gotta take you there and gotta bring you back
# You can't go any distance in a buggy or a hack #
(Train whistle)
Throw some ropes around them timbers.
We'll pull it down.
Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting Injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
- (Neighing)
- We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat railroad property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
(Man) Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
(Laughs)
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
(Concho) Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours' start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
(Concho) What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
(Laughs) Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
(Train whistle)
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
- Get outta there!
- Gah!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them railroad people.
Come on!
Come on!
(Train whistle)
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
- Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
- Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the railroad.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
(Clicking)
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
- Was she pretty?
- Mm-hm.
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
(Clamouring)
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
(Man) Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart.
- I think you're smart.
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right. (Laughs)
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
(Horse whinnies)
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
(Charlie) Is there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
(Charlie yelps)
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "I wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
- Well, then, why?
- Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns, huh?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the railroad, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- (Whitey) How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- (Whitey) So you don't want him in, huh?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- (Whitey) Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
(Laughs)
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too, huh?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any part of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey.
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
(# You Can't Get Far Without A Railroad)
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# You can't get far without a railroad
# You gotta have an engine and you gotta have a track
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
# There are tracks across the prairie
# Where the buzzard builds his nest
# There are tracks across the Rockies
# To the Golden West #
How does it go from there?
How does it go from there, Lee?
Everybody will be neighbours
In this little dream of mine
Take you clear across the country
On the Bullfrog Line
# Oh, you can't get far without a railroad
- # You can't get far without a railroad #
- Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite short.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
(Verna) Grant!
(Whitey) McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- (Man) What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the short way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the railroad!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the railroad.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
(Clicks)
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
(Train whistle)
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

Don't lose all your matches.
- Hello, Mac.
- Hi, Click.
Howdy, folks.
- Hi.
- Hello.
Welcome home, man.
Come sit down and give us a tune.
- We'll pay you with promises.
- A man can't eat promises.
He can't lose them at cards either.
McLaine!
- No, indeed he can't.
- Where have you been and why?
They were laying track in Wyoming.
Needed a troubleshooter.
- Didn't need me.
- That's too bad.
You can pick up a few nickels and dimes playing your accordion.
That's right, Tim.
What's this?
Playing cards with matches?
When's payday?
Tomorrow, if they get the money past Whitey Harbin.
Which they won't.
He's tapped that pay train three times up.
They'll get it past him or get no more steel before snow.
- O'Brien, shut your mouth!
- My sentiments exactly.
Day shift and night shift, night shift and day shift.
No money in a month.
My patience is ended.
So is their rail road.
Am I right?
- You are right!
- McLaine.
Please play me a peaceful tune or I'll have a revolution on my hands.
I see what you mean.
Are they giving you trouble?
Lucky you're not with the rail road.
Tis a weary man you'd be today if you were troubleshooting for us.
Could be you're right, Tim.
Come on, pretty lady.
Give us a dance!
I dare you, Mr Feeney.
Where's the wife?
Come on!
Big Ed, are you through to Junction City?
This is for Kimball.
As per your instructions, this is to advise you that Grant McLaine is here at end of track.
You don't need that last.
Just say he's here.
Get away from him!
Get away from him!
Dancing, is it?
Let me...
Get back into your tent where you belong, you painted women.
You and your rail road.
Bringing the likes of this among decent folk.
For two cents I'd take me old man back to Junction City and be through with you.
If you had two cents!
They're at it again.
You can't mix wives and women, even to build a rail road.
Stop this shilly-shally music and give me a jig I can dance to.
Give us a jig, I said.
You watch your feet.
They're heavy.
And so is my fist.
Do I get a jig or do you lose your teeth?
Not now, Mac, not now.
He's not bad.
He's just a fool.
Consider yourself lucky.
Five years ago you'd have got a bullet between the eyes.
I've seen him kill men that could eat you without salt.
Play what you please.
- You asked for a jig, now dance to it!
- Here I go, Feeney!
Hee-hee!
UP Garryowen!

I haven't heard that one.
Where does it come from?
Dad used to play it when it got too rough around the house.
Pretty soon us kids would stop fighting and start dancing.
The man makes fine music.
Are we gonna let them use it all up?
Go on with you!
Clarence Feeney, stop looking at them painted hussies and give your wife a dance.
- Go away, woman, I'm tired.
- Tired, is it?
This is my day for dancing or fighting.
Which will you have?
Darling.
Nice work.
I'll give you five dollars tomorrow.
If Whitey lets the pay train through.
Three times is enough.
He won't hit it again.
Oh, don't bet on it.
He's a strange man, this Whitey Harbin.
He's got the big boss plenty worried.
Speaking of Kimball, he wants to see you.
- How would he know where I am?
- I told him.
Here.
You read it.
I'm afraid if I stop the music,
Mrs Feeney'll hit me with something.
"Report to me at once in Junction City.
Urgent.
Ben Kimball."
- Maybe he'll give you...
- Another chance?
No.
That's not his way.
- But you will see him?
- Not till they've finished their dance.
- You old hag, I'll...
- Painted hussy!
Let go of me!
Let go!
Let her go, I said!
- Hold this.
- Right.
And this is the tune your father used to play to keep peace in the house?
I must have squeezed out a few wrong notes.
Yeah.
- Thanks, Tim.
- Goodbye, Mac.
- Too late for coffee, mister?
- Howdy.
I think there's a few warm dregs left.
- Oh.
Howdy, ma'am.
- Step down.
Much obliged.
- They keeping you busy?
- Yep.
Packing out the ore and packing in the vittles.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
- Now they want me to bring in a mill.
- All at once?
No, just a few pieces at a time.
They got tired of waiting for the rail road to reach them.
Between you and me, I don't think it will before snow.
You're hoping it won't?
First I was.
Figured it'd put me out of business.
It won't.
- It won't?
- No.
It's a funny thing about gold.
There's always some jackass will find it where the rail road ain't.
Then he'll send for me and a few more jackasses to bring in his grub and pack out his ore!
Them crazy miners!
Look at the waste of that good machinery.
Two miles of cable and buckets to go with it.
Last week they up and left the whole thing!
Did the vein pinch out or did they hit low grade?
They didn't hit nothing but blue sky.
- This was mighty fine coffee, Mrs...
- Miss Vittles.
Miss Vittles.
I sure appreciate it.
- I got a long ride ahead of me.
- You heading for Junction City too?
Yes, ma'am.
But I'm kind of in a hurry.
I ain't looking for company.
Ten jackasses in a bunch is enough.
- I can save you a trip round the mountain.
- How's that?
Like I told you, the boys hit a good vein, followed it through the mountain.
Last week they busted out on the far side and there wasn't nothing there but blue sky.
Makes a mighty fine shod cut into town.
- It sure does.
- Still think I'm crazy?
I think you're real pretty.
- You going to spend time in these hills?
- Yes, ma'am.
When snow comes you're gonna need a woman.
Or a warm coat, else you'll freeze your knees.
Well, I can't rightly afford a warm coat.
So long, Miss Vittles.
People wonder what a calf feels when he gets roped.
Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the rail road, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, son of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
- I'll get the eggs.
- No, get the pie.
I can pay for the pie.
You're a very stubborn man.
Apple pie is not for breakfast.
It is if you like apple pie.
Now I need a fork.
- Working here long?
- About three weeks.
How's the Utica Kid?
He was well... when I saw him last.
When was that?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
Well, business is early and Pete is late.
The lunches.
Are they fixed?
Why do I ask?
The lunches are always fixed.
Why?
Because you fix them.
Charlie, I'll make you an omelette like only Pete can make an omelette.
Very bad.
Come on around, sit down, have a cup of coffee.
Pete had that place in Santa Fe, remember?
Are you running a shoe store on the side?
Those are box lunches for the work train.
Money, money, money.
Pete knows how to make it.
He follows the rail road.
I guess a lot of people follow the rail road.
You and Pete.
The Utica Kid.
I asked when you saw him last.
They've lost three payrolls.
Now when did you see him last?
- Charlie, where did I put my apron?
- It's under here.
You must be nice fella.
If Charlie sits with you, you must be nice fella.
I make omelette for you too.
We were talking about the Utica Kid.
He can wait.
Ben Kimball's in town.
They put his car on the siding yesterday.
- I know.
- His wife is with him.
Is she?
I often wondered what Verna was like.
I saw her last night.
All fine silk and feathers.
She's soft and beautiful.
And I can understand now.
Can you?
How long are you gonna be in town?
- That depends on Ben Kimball.
- You working for the rail road again?
- if I am?
- That would be good.
Playing the accordion's not for you, not for a living.
You belong to the rail road and it belongs to you.
There were a lot of things that used to belong to me and somehow I lost them.
Two omelettes a-comin' up.
- Do you like eggs?
- No.
That's too bad.
You got an omelette coming up.
Well, somebody's gotta eat them.
Come on.
That means you.
- Could you put it in a box?
- An omelette?
I'll be hungrier when I get to end of track.
Maybe it will go down easy.
Easy or not, it goes down right now.
I can't pay for it.
Then you can help me sell lunches at the station.
Any more arguments?
Come in.
- You want to see me, Ben?
- I certainly do.
Hello, Grant.
Sit down.
All right, Jeff.
Renner, go to Pete's and get one breakfast and a jug of coffee.
- You haven't eaten yet?
- I've eaten.
Just get coffee.
Hot.
- How's everything been going?
- I make a living.
- Playing an accordion?
- That's right.
Want me to play a tune for you?
There's other jobs besides railroading.
Well, Colorado may be big in miles.
It's kinda shod on people.
So when a man gets fired the way I was fired the story gets around.
Well, I'm...
I'm sorry.
- No, I like to make music.
- And it keeps you near the rail road.
If someone needs information about a payroll, you can sell it.
You know it's a funny thing.
I don't like you either.
- Is that why you sent for me?
- No.
And keep out of this.
Have it your way.
But I don't trust him now any more than I did when I sent him after the Utica Kid.
I sent you after a thief and you gave him a horse to get away on.
- I told you to keep shut.
- Let him talk.
I'm not wearing a gun.
I'll be honest with you.
He'd talk the same if I was.
- It's been nice seeing you.
- Grant.
I'm sure Jeff didn't mean to be rude.
Sometimes he has a blunt way of putting things.
Unfortunately, Ben isn't much better.
It's not unfortunate.
It just gets things said in a hurry.
Too much of a hurry.
They forgot to ask you if you'd work for the rail road again.
Would you?
Yes, I would.
Not to give you a short answer.
- It's the answer I wanted.
- Sit down, Grant.
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
Used to work down in Arizona and New Mexico.
- Yeah.
- Well, he's moved into Colorado.
I thought he favoured stage lines and banks.
So did we.
But he's learned about rail road payrolls
- and he's grabbed three in a row.
- Where do I fit in?
They're making up a supply train in the yard.
I want you to ride it.
- With $10,000 in your pocket.
- Why me?
Quite frankly, because no one would suspect you of carrying a payroll.
I sure don't look like $10,000, do I?
Are you building a bridge you don't need?
The money's here.
Why not bring the men in on Saturday and pay them off in town?
And lose half the crew?
Turn them loose in a mining town, they'll go up the hills looking for gold.
It won't work.
And we have to finish this section before snow comes.
That's a pretty big gamble on a man who gave his horse to a thief!
Yes.
You might as well know the deck's stacked against you.
A boxcar will be hooked to the train.
I'll be one of the men in it.
- When did this happen?
- Last week.
- Renner, did you know?
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I told him not to.
- Why?
- Everything we plan gets back to Whitey.
- You think I'd tell him?
- You might trust the wrong people.
- If he takes the job, I'm sure of it.
- And if I don't take it?
Then Jeff will be sitting in Ben's chair.
Oh, I wouldn't like that.
So I'll take the job on one condition.
If I make the delivery I get his job.
You made a deal.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
It's getting cold up in the hills.
This coat has always been too long for me.
Thanks.
Well.
I thought you didn't like him.
He said that.
I said I didn't trust him.
And I still don't.
Grant.
Are you surprised Ben sent for you?
I was until I talked to him.
He seems to have changed.
You're right.
He doesn't belong in a private car with clerks, figures and pressure from the office.
He belongs at the end of track, running a gang and building a rail road.
- He's a working stiff like you.
- Yes, but he can dream a little too.
Colorado wouldn't have a rail road if he hadn't sold them on the idea.
For his sake, I wish he hadn't.
He was happy at end of track but they kicked him upstairs and sent us to Chicago.
- And now he needs a little help.
- That's why he sent for you.
Oh, I may have had something to do with it.
Why?
There was a time when you were interested in me.
I was more than interested in you.
I wanted to marry you.
Times when I'm sorry you didn't.
Aren't you?
No.
A man likes to know his woman will back him when he's down and you didn't.
Ben called me a thief and you went right along with him.
It's as simple as that.
Grant.
For old times' sake.
For old times' sake?
Just that and nothing more?
Perhaps just a little more.
We want to be sure that payroll goes through, don't we?
I don't know.
Maybe Jeff is right.
His type seldom changes.
And if we've made a mistake, it's the finish of everything.
Then why not cut this car into the supply train?
If we're all playing showdown, I'd like to see the cards when they fall.
- Thank you.
I hope you have a nice trip.
- Thank you.
Ma'am, is that all?
- Here's your lunch.
You've earned it.
- Thanks.
- Mister, are you going to end of track?
- Yes.
Could you stake me to a ticket?
I can ride half fare if I'm with an adult.
- And you're an adult.
- Well, sometimes I wonder.
All right.
You can come along.
We'll ride with the other fellas with no money.
- On the flatcar?
- Go on.
Climb aboard.
Plenty of fresh air.
Do you good, make you grow.
Are you sure he didn't come while I was away?
Ain't nobody been here but the man riding the sorrel.
- What color horse your man riding?
- How should I know?
It's extremely important that I see him.
They've cut in Mr Kimball's car.
Barley!
A man told you to put his horse up...
Don't start that too.
That there sorrel is the only horse what come in.
That there sorrel is the horse I want.
He belongs to my friend Grant McLaine.
McLaine?
That's who it is.
I knew him as a troubleshooter in Santa Fe before he went bad.
- He didn't go bad.
- What'll you do with his horse?
- Ride him!
I'll change, you saddle him.
- All right.
Hey, Pilgrim!
Come here!
Don't go getting your liver all upset.
- Once you miss 'em, they stay missed.
- It's none of your business.
- Could be.
You wanting to get on that car?
- If I am?
- I can take you to where it's going.
- On one of these?
They'll get you to end of track before the train does.
- That's ridiculous.
- $100 again yours I'm right.
- You've got a bet.
- And you got stuck.
Here.
I'll let you ride Flap Ears.
- You can smoke inside, mister.
- I can smoke where I want.
You can burn too if it pleases you but it'll still cost you four bits.
- For what?
- Traveling first-class.
Otherwise ride the flats.
- You play that?
- Yeah, I play it.
- When?
- When?
Whenever somebody throws a dime in my hat.
- I ain't got a dime.
- This one's on me.
- Been up here before?
- Pad way.
- What takes you to end of track?
- A job.
Figured I'd get one at Junction City.
They told me the foremen do the hiring.
You're a little small for swinging a sledge.
- I can carry water.
- Yeah, you can carry water.
- Very important job.
- Hey!
- What are you doing here?
- He's with me, Pick.
- Where did you get him?
- Somebody threw him away.
Don't you throw him away.
He'll get lost in the mountains.
Who tells the men who build rail roads how to get through the mountains?
The river.
They just follow the river.
- Who told you that?
- I guess my dad was the first.
He had a little song about it.
♪ Follow the river ♪
♪ The river knows the way ♪
♪ Heads can go astray ♪
♪ It happens every day ♪
♪ Follow the river ♪
♪ Wherever you may be ♪
♪ Follow the river back to me ♪
Wouldn't you wanna be knowing about Concho?
- Who's Concho?
- The man you roped.
Do you wanna know?
Not unless you wanna tell me.
I ought to tell you.
He's fast with a gun.
Only know two men who are faster.
Which two men would they be?
Whitey Harbin for one.
I run away from Whitey.
That's why Concho was after me.
You're one of Whitey's men?
No.
I was in Montrose.
Whitey and his bunch were robbing a bank.
I was just in the road watching.
Whitey was all for killing me but the other fellow wouldn't let him.
He swung me up into the saddle and said,
"You ain't killing a kid.
Not while I ride with you."
- Whitey, he backed down.
- Cos the fella's faster with a gun?
Like lightning.
This other fella, does he have a name?
He's got a name.
The Utica Kid.
I'd have stayed with the bunch if he was boss.
- But he's not?
- Not yet.
Always he's shoving pins into Whitey, laughing at him, driving him crazy.
Even crazier than he is!
Someday Whitey will crack and he'll lose.
Is this the fresh air you were talking about?
How come them fellas can ride inside?
Well, it's the old story of good and evil.
If you spend all your money on whiskey, you have none left for a ticket.
Don't drink.
Then you'd have six bits when you need it.
That's very true.
Tell you what, maybe I have six bits.
Yeah.
What do you say we go in and spend it?
Come on.
Guess I wasn't tough enough to follow the river that way.
Sometimes it isn't easy traveling upstream.
- That will be a dollar.
- That'll be six bits.
I'm the adult.
Here.
Hold on to that.
- Don't worry about Concho.
- You would if...
Oh, no, come on.
Sit down.
We can both worry together if you want to tell me about it.
- It's nothing.
- And if it was, you'd rather not say.
All right.
I broke with Whitey.
Doesn't mean I have to talk.
No, you don't have to talk.
I even broke with the Utica Kid.
- Hi, Utica.
- Put him away, Howdy.
Sure.
Come on.
It's a pretty good rig.
Too good for the guy that owned it.
Remember that draw you taught me?
It worked.
He went down with his gun in the leather.
- And now you're an "in case" man.
- In case?
Yeah.
In case you miss six times with one, you draw the other.
- If you have time.
- I'll have time.
Call it.
Draw!
You better learn to draw that one before you fool around with the other.
About three inches high, Whitey.
You better take another look at that skull.
Next time it could be yours.
Don't soft-foot up behind me!
It makes me nervous!
So I notice.
What else did you notice?
Did you see Concho?
- Did you see him?
- He wasn't on the trail.
Did I ask you where he wasn't?
I asked you did you see him?
- I would've said so.
- Not straight out you wouldn't.
Because you're a funny man.
You've always gotta be laughing inside.
Well, go ahead, laugh.
But get this, Kid.
I'm a better gun than you.
Or would you like to try?
It's an interesting thought, but I'm afraid of you, Whitey.
You ain't afraid of me.
And in your feet, where your brains are, you think maybe you're just a bit faster.
And you know something?
It could be.
Before you break up completely, you mind putting a name on this?
It's just a little old wedge.
But when you put it through the latch of a boxcar, you can't open the door from the inside.
Now, you ask me, who would want to open the door of a boxcar from the inside?
- Jeff Kurth and a dozen gunmen.
- How would you know?
I was sleeping up there when Concho told you.
You better learn how to snore!
You wouldn't know how to shoot a man in the back.
I'll learn.
What'll it be, gents?
We got Old Grandpa, Old Grandma, Old Uncle Tom.
- And Old Empty.
- You ain't funny, Latigo.
Who could be funny, sweating it out in here?
Get away, boy.
You're too young for whiskey even if we had plenty.
Don't get fancy.
You ain't talking to Joey.
Speaking of Joey, you didn't happen to spot him along the trail, did you?
I'll take a shot of that Old Flannelmouth.
- Did you see him?
- No.
Did he leave any sign?
A little.
He was headed toward Junction City.
But you didn't follow him?
Joey always was a nuisance.
I was for dropping him in the river.
- Why didn't you?
- And get my brains shot out?
You've got to find a better reason to kill me.
Suppose Concho didn't catch up with Joey in town and suppose the kid talked?
- He won't talk.
- Maybe not, but Concho ain't back.
Unless he gets back, we won't know where they're carrying the money.
That's right.
Maybe it'd be smart to let this one go through.
Why?
We've grabbed three in a row.
Let's give them a breather.
That makes sense.
I go along with Utica.
You and me both.
We ought to let this one go through.
It ain't going through!
Why not?
You're the one who taught me about payrolls and now I like them.
- So do I.
- I'll buy that.
A man can get saddle-sore looking for a bank to take.
- I'm with Whitey.
- Me too.
What about you, Torgenson?
I got no complaints.
You call it, I'll play it.
Looks like you've been outvoted.
Or do you want a recount?
- Right now, I'd rather have a drink.
- Suit yourself.
If I can't buy a fight, I'll buy a drink.
Fill 'em up.
Sorry, the bar is closed.
On account of we're fresh out of whiskey.
Either get this floor fixed or get a new bartender.
When do we make the hit?
Any time you're ready.
She was halfway up the grade when I left.
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you ask me?
Funny man!
Mount up!
Settle down.
It's only another job.
But if you was boss, we wouldn't do it.
If I was boss we wouldn't do it.
You ain't boss!

Torgenson!
- OK, John.
- Hurry it up, Jubilee!
- Boy, they're pushing her fast today.
- Yeah!
Maybe they heard I needed a quick ten thousand.
- That water tower your idea?
- What's wrong with it?
Any self-respecting injun could walk away with it.
Funny man!
He knows everything about everything.
Let's get down and lock the barn door.
We've stopped!
Whitey's making his hit!
- McLaine sold us out!
- No, Ben.
They didn't learn it from Grant.
Leary!
- A hold-up!
- They did it again!
Stop your moaning and hold on to your hat!
They won't stop old Tommy Shannon with a tank full of water.
That's no way to treat rail road property, Mr Shannon.
Take your hand off the throttle and reach for the brake!
All right.
Sit down and behave!
Come over here.
Open the safe!
- Ha!
- Move in!
Same as last time!
- We thought you were lost or drunk.
- There ain't nothing in there.
Jubilee!
How are you making out?
Try to talk your way out of this!
- I'm sorry I missed out with Renner.
- Never mind.
Where's the money?
- It's not in the safe.
- Then where is it?
It could be going to Junction City with Jeff's men.
That's not true.
Renner told us Jeff wouldn't carry the payroll!
That's a help.
Least we know who didn't carry it.
Funny man!
When you get through laughing, see what's in that red car.
Sure.
Glad to.
As soon as I pick up my horse.
He's worth more than anything I'm gonna find on this train.
Get those pilgrims out.
Maybe one of them is carrying it.
Hit the other cars!
See if you can find it.
Outside!
All of you!
Is this what you wanted to tell me?
Have a look inside, Latigo!
If that's McLaine...
No, Ben.
Put it away.
You may as well be comfortable.
- Be my guest.
- Gladly.
Do you mind if I ask the name of my host?
No, I don't mind.
Would the payroll be in there?
No.
Why not take a look, just to be sure?
Boy, is this stuff mellow.
Bottled in bond too.
- I forgot.
Ladies is always first.
- Thank you, no.
See for yourself.
Hello, Joey.
What are you doing here?
Getting robbed!
Don't bother.
None of them's got more than two dollars.
Whitey!
There ain't no payroll in there.
How come you missed out?
- I had a little trouble.
- Now, ain't that too bad?
- Maybe I ought to give you a little more.
- Whitey!
Kimball's back there with his wife.
You just got lucky!
Put them back in the car!
Get aboard!
Go on.
Good little boys don't run away.
This time you'll learn!
- Where's the payroll?
- The man says he doesn't know.
I can help him remember.
Take her outside.
Take her outside yourself.
I'm afraid of women.
They scream and scratch, and sometimes step on your toes.
Don't say no to me.
Not when I got a gun in my hand.
I won't.
Unless I'm holding one too.
- Outside.
- If you want the payroll...
You'll have to wait for the next work train.
We decided not to send it through on this one.
Oh?
I don't mind waiting.
I'll be at Pay Load.
You can bring it to me.
Then I'll take 12 hours start, you get your wife back.
See what happens when you don't carry your brains in your feet?
I ought to make you walk.
Jubilee, lead them out.
Step up with Latigo.
What about Joey?
You gonna leave him here?
He'll ride with me.
Or would you like to?
Settle down.
We're getting $10,000 for the lady, remember?
Which one do I ride with?
Which one do you think?
Take her to the end of track, Mr Shannon!
Here's a stirrup.
Give you a lift?
I'll take that box.
Don't crowd the cantle.
You'll ride easier.
Whoa, mules!
Must have got tired of making the climb and started home.
- Come on, boy!
- Just a minute.
There's a mining town near here.
It used to be called Pay Load.
It's still called Pay Load but nobody lives there.
- It's over beyond that far hill.
- Which hill?
- You see the first hill?
- Yes.
See the second one?
There's a third hill.
Pay Load's behind that.
- How much do you want for this mule?
- $50.
Flap Ears, when you unload this piker, you come on home to mother.
Get outta there!
Welshing on a bet!
Never could understand them rail road people.
Come on!
Come on!
- Mr Kimball.
- Come over to the telegraph shack.
Before you pass.
Did you bring the payroll?
Not now!
- Did you bring it?
- I didn't.
- Now what?
- The end of the rail road.
- Shut up, Feeney.
- Let go of me or I'll push this down your throat!
Who wants your man?
I don't want none of 'em!
They're all broke!
- See you in Denver.
- I'm off to Denver too.
- So am I!
- Nobody goes without orders from Kimball!
- I'm leaving.
- You are not.
You'll take no joyride in this town with them painted hussies.
We've waited this long.
Another night won't hurt us.
But if the money's not here in the morning, out we go!
Get back to work!
We're beat, Mr Kimball.
Without the pay, the gang will go to Junction City.
- I know.
- Any word from Jeff?
He's in Junction City.
Says the car held to the grade all the way.
He and his men will be after Whitey in...
They will not!
Tell him to stay right where he is until further orders.
Yes, sir.
Wonder if he thinks that's private property.
If he tries to divide that like he cuts up the loot, there's gonna be shooting.
- Your laundry?
- Sandwiches.
Do you want one?
No.
Where did you get them?
Junction City.
A girl in a restaurant gave them to me.
Was she pretty?
- Think you could get me a date?
- She's not that kind of a girl.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- You ain't got a drink.
- I got a drink.
- I thought you was fresh out.
- I was till we made the hit.
While you looked for the payroll that wasn't there, I had important business.
Come on, fill her up.
Latigo ought to be running this bunch.
We might not eat, but we'd sure drink.
Ha ha!
You're a funny man.
Why don't you laugh?
- Am I supposed to?
- Not if you're smart
- I think you're smart
- And what else do you think?
That you made a mistake.
She'll only bring you trouble and guns.
Since when is $10,000 trouble?
That's exactly what you're worth.
You're very flattering.
But I'm inclined to agree with you.
Don't make a habit of it.
Latigo, I want a drink!
And you've got a few habits I don't like either.
Settle down.
Do you see what she's up to?
I can see you.
And what I see I don't like too good.
- I guess you could use one.
- Thank you, no.
- It's the best.
I got it off your own bar.
- You drink it.
Sorry, lady, I don't drink.
I'm studying to be a bartender.
- Don't you drink?
- Not alone.
Suppose I join you?
- Do you mind?
- And if I do?
Don't push it.
For a little while you're gonna need me and I'm gonna need you.
I watched you walk.
I could swear we've met before.
Could you?
Funny little things you do.
Like when you smile.
Strange.
I seem to recognise all your mannerisms, if you know what that means.
- I know what that means.
- Do you?
I'm supposed to fight Whitey over you.
With a little luck we'd kill each other.
- It's an interesting thought.
- What's interesting?
- She is.
- You're so right.
I may not send you back.
Not until you've helped me spend the ten thousand.
- You mind if we join the party?
- Yes!
You shouldn't, cos if you guess wrong you ain't gonna hang alone.
You like another drink?
- Thanks, I still have this one.
- Drink them both.
Anybody want to start the dance?
With only one girl?
Get back to the bar where you belong.
Let's all get back to the bar, where we belong.
- You almost got your wish.
- One of them.
- The other?
- To know your name.
His name?
He's the Utica Kid.
I don't like it either.
My family used to call me Lee.
Why don't you?
You're supposed to be outside.
Come out with your hands up.
- What are you doing here?
- I want to see the Utica Kid.
- Who are you?
- A friend of his.
Funny thing, he never told me about no girlfriend.
ls there any reason why he should?
- What's your name?
- Charlie Drew.
And you can put that gun away.
Or do I look dangerous?
Not exactly.
Give me that rope.
- When'd you get here?
- Just before they rode in.
Utica pulled the job off right on schedule.
I suppose you've known it was going to happen for quite some time.
No, I haven't.
Utica doesn't talk to me about jobs.
Not this kind.
- Did he ever have any other kind?
- He will have.
Soon.
Then why don't you hold out?
Why don't you keep away till he stops being a thief?
I told him that's what I'd do.
He just looked at me and smiled.
He said, "Hurry wonder if you can."
Tonight he has his answer.
You're here.
Yes, but only to tell him that you're...
Only to tell him I'm in town and might come looking for him.
I want to keep him alive.
I want to keep you alive.
- You know what he can do with a gun.
- I know.
Well, then, why?
Because of a little thing called self-respect.
Maybe you wouldn't understand anything about that.
For five years I've played that thing for nickels and dimes thrown into a hat.
For five years the Utica Kid has been laughing.
I may have been wrong, Charlie, but I'm not gonna make the same mistake twice.
Grant...
When you see him will you tell him that I'm here?
Leave it alone!
So all she'll bring is trouble and guns?
Did you bring the money with you?
No.
- How soon do we get it?
- I wouldn't know about that.
You should!
$10,000 is a lot of money.
And that's what he wants for me.
Well, I'd say he was selling out cheap.
Never mind what you'd say.
What did Kimball say?
If you don't know about the money, why did he send you?
He didn't send me.
I came on my own.
Why?
- Ask him.
- Well?
I wouldn't know.
Then again, maybe I would.
You were right the first time.
I can walk quiet at night and I'm a pretty good gun.
I'd like to join up with you.
You see, when a man gets fired off the rail road, he has a little trouble finding a job.
And when he can't find a job, he gets hungry.
I've been hungry for the last five years.
Haven't I?
- How would he know?
- I'm his brother.
- His brother?
- His younger brother.
Five years ago he was a troubleshooter for Kimball.
I lifted the feed herd and he came after me.
Then gave you a horse to get away.
But not until I'd heard all about good and evil.
I didn't buy what he had to sell then.
I'm not buying it now.
- So you don't want him in?
- No.
Funny thing.
I want him in.
- Any objections?
- It ain't that simple, Whitey.
There's a personal deal between me and him.
- About what?
- He got in my way.
That's right.
Oh, yeah, I remember you.
You're the man that fights kids.
Which way do you want it?
Get up, come on, get up!
Now one of you give him his gun.
All right, Harbin, you're the boss around here.
You call it.
I might just do that.
Well, I ain't gonna take him alone.
Then maybe you'd better move along.
Any further objections?
- Yeah.
- Now ain't that wonderful?
- I'd be happy to call it.
- You may get the chance.
You mind if the Utica Kid and me have a little talk?
Not at all.
Call me when you're ready.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the rail road again.
I figured as much.
- Troubleshooter?
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- Where did you hide it?
- I gave it to the boy.
It's in that shoe box.
Now all you have to do is go in and tell Whitey.
You're gambling I won't?
- Same old story of good and evil.
- Same old story.
You lose, Grant.
Yeah, I kind of figured that when you laughed.
I'll give you the same break you gave me.
Ten-minute start, then I tell Whitey I sent you away.
I go, that money goes with me.
So does Kimball's wife.
- No.
- Wait a minute, Lee.
Hear me out on this.
If I leave here, that boy goes with me too.
Joey?
Why do you want him?
Maybe for the good of his soul.
It's been a long time since you heard that word, hasn't it?
Mother and Dad used to bring it up once in a while when we were kids.
You were just about Joey's age.
He thinks a lot of you, doesn't he?
- He wants to grow up to be just like you.
- He may make it, with practice.
Soon he'll be holding the horses while you and Whitey hit a bank.
There's another kid lying in the barn.
He got the start that way too?
- You didn't kill Howdy?
- I didn't hurt him.
- And you're not going to hurt Joey.
- How could I do that?
It's not hard.
It's not hard.
Not when he takes your road.
Or haven't you stopped to look at it?
Why bother?
I picked it, I'll ride it.
Lee, I'm asking you again.
Give Joey a chance.
No.
You've got ten minutes.
I won't need them.
Charlie's in there waiting for you.
Think about her.
She's been following you for five years too.
She's got a reason.
Or didn't I tell you I'm gonna marry her?
How much of that did you hear?
Just what I wanted to hear.
That you're gonna marry me.
When?
We're gonna have a lot of money, Charlie.
$10,000.
You can have pretty new dresses and pretty new shoes.
And a brand-new husband.
- Tomorrow.
- No.
Right now!
If you want me, take me away right now.
Please, please take me.
Why the sudden hurry?
Has my big brother been telling you the story of good and evil?
Don't laugh at him.
Why not?
Why mustn't I laugh at him?
Maybe it would be better if... if you tried to be a little more like him.
Now isn't that just great?
Now I get it from you!
Ever since I was a kid that's all I can remember.
"Why don't you be more like your brother?
Why can't you be more like Grant?"
I don't want to be like him.
I don't want any pan of him.
- That's not true.
- Yeah, it's true!
You don't know what it's like to be the kid brother.
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you try.
Until one day I tried a gun.
Fit my hand real good.
And I wasn't the kid brother any more.
It's a good gun.
It's gonna get us everything we always wanted.
But I don't want it.
Not that way.
Why must you steal?
Because I like to steal.
I like to see what people will do when I take it away from them.
What happens when something is taken away from you?
Nobody's gonna take anything away from me.
Charlie, I'm asking you to marry me.
No.
Grant was right.
You'll never change.
And he calls me a thief?
Joey
Go on.
Play some more.
It's been a long time since I heard an accordion.
Any tune in particular?
Or would this do?
♪ Oh, you can't get far without a rail road ♪

Gentlemen!
- Renner!
- Didn't you know he was working for me?
- I've come for my thousand dollars.
- What thousand dollars?
Your memory is quite shod.
I supplied you with information about a certain boxcar.
I was prepared to supply you with information about the payroll.
- Concho did not keep the appointment.
- So?
So ten per cent of the payroll is mine.
Sorry to disappoint you but we missed the payroll.
Missed the payroll?
In that case I'm prepared to make a better deal.
For $2,000, I can tell you where the money is.
You made a deal.
Ben Kimball hired a man to carry it.
I might never have located this place if I hadn't heard that man's accordion.
He has the money.
Ask him!
Joey!
Come here, Joey!
Grant!
McLaine, there's a woman with you!
- That's right.
- Send her out before we come get you.
Here, hurry!
Come on, Charlie.
He's in the clear.
He's riding away.
Yeah, he's riding.
After me.
- What are we stopping for?
- We're going to the mill, the shod way.
Get down to the mill!
Come on!
Take cover!
Here.
There's a mine shaft at the end of these cables.
It runs clear through the mountains.
On the other side, about half a mile, is the rail road!
It's two hours to the end of track.
I have to send you out one at a time.
Come on, Verna.
- Tell Ben he'll get his payroll somehow.
- I'll tell him more than that.
You'll get that money even if you had to kill your own brother?
The next ore bucket that comes down, pull it around and jump in.
I'll cover for you.
It's clear, Charlie.
Get out!
See if you can reach him from over there.
He can't stand them off, not alone.
You figuring to help?
Grant!
Look out!
He's real good.
Only one better gun in Colorado.
Charlie!
Get over here!
- I thought I told you to get out.
- I'm staying right here.
All right.
Now you get back inside and I'll cover for you.
Thanks, Charlie.
Lee, not the kid!
You take care of the kid.
I'll see if I can keep them pinned down.
Would you mind if I play big brother just this one time?
- Shoots high.
- You or the gun?
- Joey all right?
- He's all right.
That makes you a winner.
Go ahead and make a sucker out of the kid.
Tell him all about good and evil.
Put him to work on the rail road.
Things get tough, he can always play the accordion for nickels and dimes.
Sounds like old times, Lee.
Welcome home.
Don't give me that big brother grin.
- Up there!
- Get him!
I count mine.
There's one left.
He hit you hard, Lee.
Not half as hard as you did with that Bullfrog Line.
That was Dad's favourite tune and you know it.
I know it.
You and your stinking accordion!
Charlie.
Charlie?
You and Joey get the horses.
What...?
I'll take care of my brother.
Here's your money.
Pay 'em off, Tim.
Thank you, Grant.
Looks like you won yourself a job.
Mine.
No, it won't fit.
Not nearly as well as your coat.
Want your old job back?
Thanks.
All right, Joey.
Get a bucket and start carrying water.
We're at end of track.
Now go on.

[SINGING]
ELIZABETH:
Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
[CHATTERING DOG BARKING]
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
PETER:
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
PETER:
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
JEFF:
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds."
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
PETER:
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
[ENGINE STARTS]
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
[HYENAS YIPPING]

[YELPS]
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.

ELIZABETH:
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
[BABY CRYING]
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
[BABY STOPS CRYING]
[BELL RINGS]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
KARANJA:
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
[STICKS BANG]
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
KARANJA:
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are."
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
MAN:
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana."
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
[DOG BARKING]
[GASPS]
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
NJOGU:
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?

I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.

You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
COOK:
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
[SINGING]
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
[SINGING STOPS]
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
NJOGU:
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...

CLERK:
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
NJOGU:
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
LEADER:
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
ALL:

I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.

- They make a nice couple, don't they?
- Mm.
She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?

[DOOR KNOCKS]
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
HOLLY:
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
NJOGU:
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.

Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.

A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...

Or any families to come.
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
WAITHAKA:
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
[CROWD SCREAMS]
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
[DOOR KNOCKS]
Who is it?
[DOOR KNOCKS VIOLENTLY]
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
[GASPS]
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
[PANTING]
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
MATSON:
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
[CHUCKLES]
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
[LIGHTNING CRASHES THUNDERRUMBLES]
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
HENRY:
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
GAME WARDEN:
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
[GUNSHOTS]
HOLLY:
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
HENRY:
Elizabeth.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
PETER:
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
HENRY:
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
PETER:
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
HOLLY:
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
PETER:
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
[PANTING]
[SLAP BABY CRYING]
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
MATSON:
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
[SCREAMING]
Wait.
Please.
[BABY CRYING]
[KIMANI SCREAMS]
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
[BABY MOANING CRYING]
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
PETER:
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
[BABY CRYING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
[YELLS]
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

[ENGLISH SDH]
Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds."
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are."
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana."
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
- Cigarette?
No.
- Dad?
- No, thanks.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
You'd better see to her luggage.
- Can't I watch too?
- It's indecent.
That's why I want to watch.
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
I've come to pray.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
- They make a nice couple, don't they?
- Mm.
She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Why didn't you go with him?
- I was afraid.
- Afraid?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
You didn't forget my rifle?
Yes, it's right here.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
She's afraid.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds".
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
Your word will suffice.
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are".
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana".
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?
I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.
Not a sound.
Nothing.
Do not call.
Do not answer.
Do not cough or I kill you.
Understand?
You are not alone?
How many are there?
One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.
Migwe.
Migwe.
This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.
Plans to...
Flight 212, BO AC arriving from London, Rome, Athens, Cairo, Khartoum.
- Cigarette?
No.
- Dad?
- No, thanks.
Flight 212 departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
There.
Two-one-two departing for Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg and Jamestown.
Each to their own.
Holly, I...
Six years is a long time.
Too long?
You'd better see to her luggage.
- Can't I watch too?
- It's indecent.
That's why I want to watch.
Oh, really.
Kimani.
Hey.
Kimani.
Strange.
I thought I saw Kimani.
You remember Kimani?
Move.
Start moving.
Would you mind letting us by, please?
I've come to pray.
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
I swear to kill an Englishman or may this oath kill me and my family.
- They make a nice couple, don't they?
- Mm.
She's got good lines for breeding too.
Look.
Mount Kenya.
Lathela, wait here.
No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.
Home is always like this.
Why did your husband run away?
Did he steal?
Did he do something bad?
Where did he go?
Why didn't you go with him?
- I was afraid.
- Afraid?
Afraid of what?
Hello, my darling.
Hello, my darling.
What did you bring?
Hello.
You didn't forget my rifle?
Yes, it's right here.
Henry.
Bring the children in.
Bring them in.
What do you think?
What's it mean?
I don't know.
Two Kyukes disappear from my place.
Jasper, his headman reports one gone from his farm, rifle missing too.
One gone from your place.
Why?
You saw his wife.
She's afraid.
Why?
What of?
Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.
Thank you for a lovely day.
Lovely wedding day.
- No more anxiety?
- Mm-mm.
- You know why?
- Why?
Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.
I wonder what's happened to the porch light.
Probably the fuse again.
I'll have a look at it.
Hey, what the...?
Ugh!
KIMANl:
Remember me?
Kimani.
- What do you want?
- I've come home.
Jeff!
KIMANl:
No.
Kimani.
Jeff Newton and two of his children dead.
His wife, Elizabeth, in critical condition.
On the open highway to Nanyuki in broad daylight Joe Matson and Mrs. Matson were ambushed while motoring.
Mrs. Matson was killed by machine-gun bullets.
Chief Waruhiu, leader of the anti-Mau Mau movement was murdered at Kiambu.
MEYLl:
Yes, bwana.
Were you in your hut last night?
MEYLl:
Yes.
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
Where is Jeff and the kids?
What's your name?
MEYLl:
Meyli.
Who was with you?
MEYLl:
My husband and my children.
And the mother of my husband.
Did you ever attend any Mau Mau meetings?
MEYLl:
No, bwana.
Next, please.
Mrs. McKenzie, what type blood are you?
- Type O.
- Come along, please.
Hurry.
Anybody else here with type O blood?
Peter?
Lathela is, I think.
Which one of you is known as Lathela?
Is that you?
Come with me.
We need blood to help Memsahib Elizabeth.
Papa.
Why Elizabeth?
Why the kids?
Why?
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
Hey, you, listen carefully.
You are surrounded by police.
Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
Who is it?
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
Elizabeth.
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
Wait.
Please.
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.
[SINGING]
ELIZABETH:
Darling.
- Papa, have I kept you waiting?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
- Why isn't Peter here?
- He's playing with Kimani, Papa.
That brother of yours and that Kyuke are inseparable.
Can't he find a white playmate?
Why?
You can't treat an African like a brother and expect to have a good servant.
When Caroline died, Kimani's mother raised Peter.
In a way, they are brothers.
[WHISTLE BLOWS]
When do you leave for England?
Tomorrow, worst luck.
I'm homesick already.
A few years of school...
You won't let him marry anybody but me, Mr. McKenzie, will you?
Has he proposed?
No, but I have, quite often.
Which of you stole the rifle?
Step forward.
Your religion says it is evil to steal.
Your own medicine shall name the liar.
If you tell the truth, this will not burn your tongue.
He who lies burns.
Peter?
Kimani, my son, shall be the first.
Did you steal that gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
Did you steal the gun?
[CHATTERING DOG BARKING]
I will find the weapon and bring it to you.
Punish him yourself.
The city teaches bad ways to young men.
How does it go with your wife?
The wife with child?
Tomorrow, the day after...
The time is near.
Papa.
- How does it work?
- Plain old witchcraft.
The Kikuyu is a very religious man.
He fears God, but he trusts him too.
- But hot steel is...
- Will not burn a wet tongue.
But the liar's spit dries up.
Him it will scorch.
Ha-ha-ha.
I think you know more about black witchcraft than you do about the Bible.
- Let me have my way with these devils...
- Poor old Jeff is the perfect colonizer.
What's his is his and what's theirs is his too.
Well, have a good shoot.
We're not raising cattle to feed a maverick lion.
PETER:
Kimani, Lathela.
Tell Kimani not to gut him.
We'll leave a smelly calling card for the lion.
Kimani, open the animal, but don't clean him.
Then you'd better service the guns.
When it comes time to kill the lion, I want to shoot the gun too.
It's Jeff's show.
And you know how he feels about Africans and guns.
KIMANl:
I want to shoot the gun too.
PETER:
I'm sorry.
Lathela.
KIMANl:
Always when we hunt it is the same.
You have all the fun, I do all the work.
When we were little and played together...
But we're big now.
And things are not the same.
Hit him.
Hit him.
Hit him hard.
Do what he says, now.
And in a hurry.
From now on, when he tells you to do something, do it.
Don't think about it, just obey.
Understand me?
Well?
Come on, Peter.
I really should've slapped you.
Might have been better all around if you had.
Heh-heh.
Forget it.
You had no right to hit Kimani.
JEFF:
Peter, how many times have I got to tell you?
Blacks are blacks and not playmates.
One thing you can never do is argue with them.
Never.
You tell them.
Oh, sometimes you can joke with them you can boot them in the tail sometimes look after them when they're sick.
But you never, never argue with them.
- The world's changing, Jeff.
- Not in Africa it isn't.
Kimani's mother raised both of us.
We grew up together.
You'll never live together on equal footing.
Not in our lifetime.
You can't spend the first 20 years of your life with someone sharing bread and secrets and dreams, and then one day say:
"Sorry, it's all over.
We live in different worlds".
I don't believe it and I don't like it.
Wait till you settle down and marry Holly and have to deal seriously with the wogs.
Have you heard from Holly?
A couple of letters from London.
She mentioned coming back?
Just stuff about school, things like that.
Hm...
Well, we'd better break camp and go after that lion.
Lathela.
Get Kimani to help you load.
Kimani not here.
PETER:
Where?
Forget that lion, Jeff.
We're gonna find Kimani, and right now.
All right, all right, all right.
[ENGINE STARTS]
You want Lathela with you?
No, you'll need him to track.
I'll meet you back here at sundown.

- Yes, bwana.
- Does it hurt much?
- No, bwana.
You're lying.
- And stop calling me bwana.
- What shall I call you?
"Boss"? "Master"?
Yes, it hurts.
Not where the trap cut me only where Jeff slapped me.
That is where it hurts.
Well, then stop thinking about it.
No one ever struck me in anger before.
Not even my own father.
It wasn't in anger.
He's already forgotten.
Can you forget it?
I cannot forget it either.
We are alike in many things.
You talk Kikuyu same as me.
I speak English same as you.
But you are white and I am black.
And you are the bwana and I am the servant.
And I carry the gun and you shoot.
- Why is shooting the gun so important?
- It's not the gun, it is...
What is it, then?
What?
We cannot talk as friends.
Why?
You said it yourself.
We are not children anymore so we are not friends anymore.
I saved your life as a friend.
I'll always be your friend.
Kimani...
Does it hurt much?
No.

ELIZABETH:
The child doesn't come easily.
It is a curse.
This morning, I saw the dung of a hyena.
Just now a vulture passed over us.
Don't you talk like that.
Just don't you talk like that.
- Suppose the child is born feet first.
- Then it must be killed.
When that child comes, don't you touch it.
You understand?
It is you who do not understand.
I'm gonna fetch my father.
White magic will not remove the curse.
- Perhaps the curse is in your son?
- What evil did he do?
Suppose a snake came into his bed.
Suppose a man struck him and he did not strike back.
Suppose he broke a law.
[BABY CRYING]
The child enters life feet first.
Do what must be done.
[BABY STOPS CRYING]
[BELL RINGS]
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
Kimani.
Swear him in.
- Which god, please?
- The Christian God.
I worship Ngai, the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
I will swear by our sacred Githathi stone.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Your word will suffice.
KARANJA:
Oh, no, no.
If I lie before this symbol of God my children and their children and my home and my land will turn to dust.
[STICKS BANG]
And when I die I will have no life hereafter except to live forever in eternity by the cursed hyena, cowardly eater of the dead.
I speak the truth.
You're the father of the dead baby in question?
- Yes.
- Did you tell the midwife to kill the baby?
Yes.
It was born feet first, it was cursed.
Then what was done?
What is always done according to custom.
CROWN COUNSEL:
Tell His Honor what that is.
We smothered the child and buried it under a pot.
- You know that killing is against the law?
- God says to murder is wrong.
And when you had that newborn baby smothered, was that not murder?
No.
A child cannot join the tribe until he is 1 year old.
Therefore, he's not really born until his second year.
What was killed was a demon, not a child.
Yes, yes.
And then what did you do?
- What?
- Then what did you do?
We sacrificed a young ram.
Mm.
And that, I suppose, got rid of the curse.
KARANJA:
No.
No, sir.
Not yet.
I am still here, therefore the curse is still at work.
Would you do the same thing if another child were born to you feet first?
Yes, yes.
It would be my duty.
What in the name of Almighty God are we trying to do to these people?
CROWN COUNSEL:
Preserve the law, Henry, that's all.
Law?
Whose law?
Not theirs, surely.
All men are equal before the law.
Except some are more equal than others.
That man is an accomplice to murder.
He's admitted that.
But can we make him understand it?
We take away their customs, their habits, their religion.
We stop their tribal dances, we stop them circumcising their women.
Then we offer them our way of life, something they can't grasp.
We say, "Look how clean and rich and clever we are".
For the Africans different wages, different life.
We mock their wise men.
Take away the authority from their fathers.
What are the children going to do?
They'll lose respect for their elders and fathers and when they do, look out.
Maybe they'll lose respect for our white Jesus too.
Turn to something else for help.
It won't be to us.
Well, you understand, don't you, Peter?
If we don't make the African respect the law well, the next thing you know, he'll be wanting to rule this country.
Imagine that, now.
Whatever could give him that idea?
This is his son.
Can he come in while we're here?
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] The city frightens me.
- Let us go home quickly.
- Listen, old friend.
The law says you must stay here in jail for a while.
I'm sorry.
We'll do everything we can.
My daughter will visit you.
She'll bring you tobacco and food to comfort you.
Please keep this for me.
A jail is not the proper place to keep god's sacred symbol.
And when my son comes of age...
I understand.
I am happy it was not you who struck my son.
You are still his friend?
Yes.
And yours too, for as long as you both wish it.
MAN:
Boy, boy.
I told you.
He will not help you.
Our Mathanjuki will purify you.
He will drive the curse from your body and I will be free.
- No.
- You do not believe in god?
- Yes, yes.
But I do not believe in our witchcraft and black magic.
When Bwana Jeff struck you...
He struck a black man to prove that the white man is master, nothing else.
You are not in jail because of a curse but only because we are judged by their laws.
And that is the truth.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
- Where does it lead you?
- To strike back.
We're men, not animals.
You have much to look forward to, my son.
You will become headman as I was.
Is that to be my life?
Headman for a white boss?
"Yes, bwana.
No, bwana.
Yes, bwana".
This land can serve me too.
I want my own land.
Then you must earn it.
I will, Father.
I will.
[DOG BARKING]

Who are you?
Who sent you here?
Why you come here?
He told me to come here.
You told me the white man would put Father in jail.
- You said we had to fight the white man.
- Your father is in jail?
- Yes, and I'm ready to fight.
- You ran away from the McKenzie shamba?
- Yes.
- Why?
- You stole money?
- No.
- Guns?
No, why should I steal?
Then why should you run?
I don't know.
NJOGU:
This is my daughter, Wanjiru.
- He can be of no use to us.
He wants to fight the white man.
We can use him.
We will take him to the mountains.
We will train him.
Come, little boy.
First you will learn to steal guns.
Hm?

I have no parents and I am hungry.
I need work.

One other?
The houseboy?
You will call him by name.
Nothing else, just the name.
Call him.

This boy is dead.
Nanyuki Police signing off, 1545.
- Hello, Peter.
- I need some help, Hillary.
If it's about the sentence of your headman...
His son, Kimani.
He's missing.
- When?
- Last night.
I want him found.
- What did he steal?
- Steal?
You want him found, what are the charges?
- He might be hurt.
- You check the infirmary?
And I've chased down his family within a hundred miles.
He'll show up.
He probably went to Nairobi on a toot and...
- Age?
- Twenty-one.
- Height?
- Six-two, weight a little under 13 stone.
Wait a minute.
There was a houseboy killed last night.
Buxton shamba, at the foot of the Aberdares.
A gang broke in, stole guns and whiskey.
- What's that got to do with Kimani?
- Maybe nothing.
Maybe everything.
- Not a chance.
- Why not?
I know Kimani.
I know how he thinks.
He's not a criminal.
You mean not yet.
You just find him.
At least send out a description.
Kimani's guilty of only one thing, captain.
Guilty of being born black.
[SINGING]
Take one.
Why that gun?
My friend Peter has a gun like this.
It is a fine gun.
I can kill a lion with this.
Or even a man, huh?
[SINGING STOPS]
There will be no drinking here again.
Never.
Adam is our leader.
Who are you to tell us what...?
NJOGU:
Daughter, ask the other women where to go and what to do.
Kimani.
I see you have earned a gun.
This gun.
To get some of these guns, one of our own people was killed.
When lightning strikes, a bystander may be hurt.
Lightning belongs to god.
This was murder by him.
It was the will of god.
No.
I do not like your ways.
Sit down.
I go to Nanyuki.
I work there to free my father in my own way.
Sit down.
Two reasons why you cannot leave us.
That houseboy.
That houseboy who was killed last night, Adam can hang for this.
So can you.
So can all of us.
- That is the law.
- Reason two.
You know our names and our faces.
You know where we live and how we live.
We would be safe only if you stay with us.
Or if you were dead.
We will not always live as hunted animals.
Great men make plans for us.
Plans to drive the white man from our country.
Plans to take back our land.

CLERK:
This is not a church.
My god does not live in a church.
How do you call yourself?
Kimani wa Karanja.
We are beggars and slaves in our own land.
The British allow us in their homes and hotels, yes.
But how?
As servants.
We are millions, they are a handful.
We are strong, they are weak.
How then are they the masters and we the slaves?
Is it white magic?
Is it god's will?
No.
They have the guns.
We too shall have guns.
Are we ready for this?
The whole colored world burns with the fever of revolt with the fire for freedom.
Do any of you have any questions?
Is there a doubt in your hearts?
What troubles you?
NJOGU:
Kimani.
His name is Kimani wa Karanja.
For five years, he has been in the mountains with us.
He is ready for leadership.
He is very strong and loyal.
Strong men have betrayed us before.
- You have a question, Kimani?
KIMANl:
Yes, sir.
- This talk of guns.
LEADER:
Yes?
Is this the only way we can get freedom?
Yes.
- By the spilling of blood?
- Yes.
We will never drive the British out with words.
And not with doubts and not with friendship.
It can only be done with guns.
The white man did not take this land with guns.
He bought this land.
- This is truth.
- Mm-hm.
And I must follow where the truth leads me.
You were educated in white missionary schools?
Yes, sir.
Long, long ago, to whom did the land belong?
- The people.
- Yes.
Not one person, but the entire clan.
And therefore only the clan can sell the land correct?
- Yes, sir.
No man of any other tribe can buy our land unless he becomes, in our religion, a Kikuyu.
Yes, sir.
And have the British ever become Kikuyus?
Or have you become one of the British?
Your father was a friend of the British.
But your father died in their prison.
There is only one way to drive out the British.
By terror and death.
Everyone must either be for us or against us.
Those who be with us, stand.
Good.
We will need a symbol, a sign, a name.
Here it is.
Mau Mau.
Mau Mau.
Use it, live by it, die for it.
Mau Mau is the machinery that will carry us to freedom and independence.
Mau Mau.

No wonder the African believes that God lives on Mount Kenya.
If I were God, that's where I'd like to live.
I feel I'm really home now.
I love you, Peter.
I always have.
I suppose I always will.
I like the feel of you.
I wish...
Yes?
I wish it could always be like this moment.
Safe and warm and peaceful.
Always like this.

Come in.
According to Kikuyu custom we come to speak for Peter McKenzie, bachelor to Holly Keith, spinster.
- This shy Kikuyu maiden is grateful.
- She doesn't look very shy to me.
How many goats will be paid for me?
Three or four ought to be quite enough, don't you think?
Oh, I'd say 20 or 30 at least.
Why don't you throw yourself in and make it 31 goats?
And why has Peter wa Henry chosen me?
He needs someone to chop firewood and dig potatoes.
He needs someone to keep his bed warm.
- He promises not to beat you often.
- Unless it's absolutely necessary.
- He also expects a child every year.
- All of them his.
- A very narrow attitude.
- We shall also have to shave your head.
Do you accept my son?
If you do, we'll drink to the marriage bargain.
If you don't, I shall have to pour this on the ground.
HOLLY:
And waste all that precious gin?
Thank you for becoming one of our family.
You will swear a new blood oath.
When it is done, you will be part of the new army:
Mau Mau.
He who refuses to take the oath he dies.
He who breaks the oath he dies.
Cut off the sheep's head.
Fill this calabash with its blood.
Sugar cane.
Sugar cane and banana leaves the first source of food.
Mugere plant best and strongest magic.
The arch oldest Kikuyu symbol.
You will pass through the arch seven times and thereby enter a new life.
You will receive seven cuts on the arm to bind you together.
Seven.
All things in seven.
Seven, the unlucky number.
Break the oath and the evil seven will strike.
Sheep's blood symbol of sacrifice.
Millet seeds of nourishment.
Earth the earth we fight for.
The cause that brings us together.
You will eat this oath.
You will swallow it seven times so that it becomes part of you.
Bitter Sodom apples.
Take off everything that stinks of the European.
Watch, ring, money.
To give you an easy road.
The endless circles.
Earth.
Hold it to your belly.
That the land may feed us and not the foreigners.
Hold up your arm.
So that your blood will mix.
Now swallow the oath seven times.
Repeat after me as you pass through the arch.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
If I sell land to any foreigners, may this oath kill me.
- I will steal guns.
- I will steal guns.
I will never be a Christian.
I will never be a Christian.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
I will drive out all Europeans or kill them.
NJOGU:
It is done.
They've all sworn.
I feel unclean.
I will not let Wanjiru take this oath.
It is not necessary.
She is loyal.
To swallow the oath was hard enough, but the rest of it...
The nameless filth, the shame.
And in front of the others.
Why was it necessary?
Why?
To bind us together forever.
Now they will do anything.
Killing of mother, father, son will be as nothing to them.
They will feel strong with power and purpose.
- Who gave you the oath?
- No one.
You never took it?
I am too old to change.
I am ready to give up my life, but I cannot give up my faith.
It is too deep, too strong.
In life and in death I will always believe in the god of my father the god who lives on Mount Kenya.
- So do I, in spite of the oath.
Your daughter carries my child.
Now, I wish to marry her before the child is born.
I consider you married.
I will gather cooking stones with my wife as my father before me gathered cooking stones with my mother.
Like you, I cannot tear out what is in my heart.
Do it quickly, then.
We need rest.
Tomorrow is the appointed day of the long knives.
Our first attack should be on the McKenzie shamba.
- Why there?
- Why not?
Look, that was my home, my friends.
A great leader has no friends, only a cause.
- You doubt my loyalty?
- I only ask you to prove it.
Let your panga come back as red as mine.

Because everything's so full of life.
All the animals, the earth and even the air smells of life.
We've done nothing to spoil it.
Someday all this will be farm country.
What will happen to White Hunter McKenzie, then?
Four years ago, our crops were hit by locusts.
Wiped out.
Papa put all his savings into cattle.
The next year, rinderpest.
What cattle didn't die had to be killed.
Papa got a loan from the bank.
So part of the time, I take rich clients on safari.
For the money.
To pay back the loan.
So the land's good to us this year and the crops hold up, no locusts, no rinderpests I'll be back where I really belong.
On the farm.
You know, that's the most wonderful wedding present you could ever give me.
- Are you as happy as I am?
- I'm a very lucky man.
I have the two women I love most in the world.
- Who's the other one?
- Africa.
There are some things I can do for you that Africa can't.
What is it?
I don't know.
Something strange.
Well, I didn't hear anything.
I'm not certain.
It was something.
Just a feeling, I guess.

MAN [OVER PA]:
A state of emergency now exists in Kenya.
Kikuyus are being sworn into a terror organization called Mau Mau.
Small gangs are fighting guerrilla warfare.
There may be Mau Mau on your farms, in your cities, in your homes.
Any African found with a gun may be punished by death.
Peter, why do you have to go?
We've been over this a dozen times.
I have to go, that's all.
Yes, but there's the army...
The army is inexperienced in the mountain and the bush country.
- How long will you be away?
- I don't know.
What am I supposed to do while you're gone?
What the rest of the women are doing, help keep the place going.
Peter.
It wasn't very much of a honeymoon for you, was it?
Are you very afraid?
No, not of them.
Only for us.
It's us I'm afraid for, what will happen to us.
GAME WARDEN:
Mau Mau working underground everywhere.
Maybe right here in this room, for all we know.
Now, the government wants information.
Who's forging the ammunition permits?
Who's supplying the guns?
Who's giving the oaths?
So it's prisoners we're after.
It's your job to track them down.
I say kill them, make it open warfare, bomb them out.
Kill whom, all 6 million Africans in Kenya?
We're only 40,000.
That makes the odds about 150-to-1.
That's not the point.
We're not at war with the Kikuyu nation.
We're fighting Mau Mau.
For every one of us, they've killed a hundred Kikuyus.
- Loyal Kikuyus.
- They don't know what loyalty means.
Now, listen, man.
They're trying to drive us out.
What are we to do?
Pack up because their grandfathers were here first?
I was born here too.
This is my country.
Killing's no answer.
We gotta give the African a chance...
Black man's had Africa for years.
It'd be a jungle if we hadn't moved in.
It's not a question of black or white.
That's exactly what it is.
Black or white.
You'll follow orders or keep out of this.
Well?
All right.
I'll try it your way for a while.
No smoking.
And no fires for cooking.
Whiskey?
Jeff.
Talk to me, Papa.
I don't know what to say.
Anything, Papa.
Anything at all.
This off-season rain it should do a lot of good.
You're doing a big job, child.
Like my Caroline, a long time ago when the country was new.
She was delicate, but strong, like you.
She helped to make the land and hold it.
Like you.
No, Papa, not like me.
I'm weak.
I'm weak and I'm afraid and I'm lonely.
Papa.
Who said you could get out of bed?
I want to go to Nairobi to see the doctor.
Is it your arm again?
I know you'll think I'm mad but I'm going to have another baby.
You see, if there's any chance of it being born...
Well, I mean, after losing so much blood and...
And I want this baby, Papa.
More than I've ever wanted anything.
It'd be a little bit more of Jeff and...
Holly, will you take me in to the doctor in the morning?
[DOG BARKING]
[SINGING]
Hey, you, listen carefully.
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
You are surrounded by police.
[CHATTERING]
MATSON: [IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
Listen carefully.
[GUNFIRE]
[MATSON SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lay down your guns.
You are surrounded by police.
[CHILD CRYING]
MATSON:
All right.
Waithaka, do you know any of these people?
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
- Next.
- A good farmer, no Mau Mau.
- No?
- No, bwana.
You see?
Njogu, soldier of god.
MATSON:
How long were you in the mountains?
One year.
Do not hurt me, bwana.
Who gave you the oath?
I do not know.
If you lie to me again, I'll kill you.
Now who was it?
Who made you swear to the oath?
[THUD]
Waithaka.
Help me.
Help me.
Waithaka.
- Help me.
- The woman lies.
I never saw her before, never.
I swear.
By my father, I swear.
Here's one of your loyal Kikuyus.
All right.
We'll start again.
- You gave the oath to the girl?
- No.
- She knew your name.
How?
- She's the wife of my brother.
- Who gave you the oath?
- It was dark and raining, I could not see.
How do you Mau Mau do it?
Since when do we use torture?
The Mau Mau do it.
They love it.
- You might even grow to love it yourself.
- I don't like it any more than you do.
But I don't like what happened to Matson's wife.
Or your family.
Or any families to come.
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
We're not such a big jump away from being savages ourselves, are we?
Please.
Please let me point him out from here.
Please let me.
This is the man.
- Your name.
- Njogu.
Is he the one?
Is he the oath-giver?
You said his name was Njogu.
You said he was here.
He spoke truly.
I gave the oath to him, to all of them.
They know nothing.
And from me, you will get nothing.
WAITHAKA:
Do not let me stay...
Do not let me stay here.
You promised, bwana.
You promised, you promised, you promised.
[CROWD SCREAMS]
[WAITHAKA SCREAMS]
[DOOR KNOCKS]
Who is it?
[DOOR KNOCKS VIOLENTLY]
LITTLE JEFF:
Uncle Peter.
Excuse my appearance.
I need a drink.
- I beg your pardon.
- Let me help you, son.
That's right.
Absolutely right.
You're gonna help us all.
I need your help.
Government needs help.
Everybody needs help.
It's a big secret job.
Very important.
Toast.
Toast.
I don't think he's taken off these clothes since he left home.
He probably never had a chance.
Thank God he's all right.
Holly strange things happen to people in war.
- Inside, I mean.
- Not between us.
- He'll be the same as always, you'll see.
- Nothing's ever the same.
That's one thing you can't do, stand still.
[GASPS]
Look, his sock has rotted away inside his boot.
[PANTING]
I'd forgotten how good our earth feels.
So rich and full of life.
Can you hear the soil through my fingers?
No.
What's it saying?
How much I love you and miss you and need you.
Last night, I thought...
Last night I had a nightmare and it was...
It was a nightmare.
Somebody will see us.
Does it matter?
It isn't the same, is it?
Yes, Holly.
You make me feel ashamed.
We waited lunch for you.
- Sorry.
- Finally gave up.
I didn't realize the time.
Daydreaming?
Yes.
You can pick your dreams in the daytime.
I'm sorry you've gotta go tonight.
So am I.
It's not fair to Holly.
She's carrying a pretty heavy burden.
No more than you or a dozen other women around here.
It's not easy for Holly looking after Papa and little Jeff and me.
It's not easy going to bed with a rifle by your side night after night instead of a husband never knowing if you're going to see daylight again.
Never laughing.
Never loving.
Never knowing if the next footstep on the porch is yours or...
You're her whole life, Peter.
Don't shut her out.
I feel empty.
Dead.
It's not so bad in the daytime, in the clean hot sun.
But when it grows dark I'm afraid, I guess.
And then when I think of Holly and how much I want her and when it's the moment to touch her and be with her, I can't.
I just feel dirty, I feel unclean.
Filthy business we're in.
Time will wash it clean.
Who knows how much time there is left?
- Ready?
- Yes, yes.
Where's Holly?
She's in the bedroom.
Well?
Don't go.
Please, don't go.
You expect me to run out?
Yes.
Yes, together.
Somewhere far away, where there's no war.
We belong here, Holly.
Here, this is our land.
It was worked for and paid for.
Nobody's driving me off this land.
They can bury me in it, but nobody is chasing me off it.
Peter, darling, what does a piece of land matter?
Look what it's doing to us, to everybody.
- Please, take me away from here.
- This is our home.
- They say not.
- They lie.
War is filled with lies.
What they say, what we say, lies.
Our place is here.
My place is with you.
And you have no place for me.
I'm selfish.
I don't want to lose you.
Please, let's go away from here before it's too late.
MATSON:
Do I get the names?
The oath-givers the man who killed my wife.
Joe.
Lathela.
You are not afraid of Mau Mau?
I'm like you.
I'm too old to be frightened by men.
The wrath of God frightens me, not the brutality of men.
What do you want of me?
How is it you gave the oath to others and never took it yourself?
I believe in the faith of my father.
Good.
Who are your leaders?
Your oath-givers?
[CHUCKLES]
By speaking out, you can end the war between us.
You leave Africa and the war will end.
Can't we live in peace, your people and mine?
Go away.
Your soft words are sharper than blows.
Would you prefer violence?
I'm no ordinary man.
Nothing can make me speak out.
They have tried.
They could not do it.
Not with torture, not with pain.
You will fail also.
[LIGHTNING CRASHES THUNDERRUMBLES]
Well, that's all we needed, a spell of weather.
Ngai is angry.
What's that?
Thunder and lightning.
When it storms, the Kikuyu believes he is face-to-face with god.
Thunder is the sound of god cracking his joints preparing for battle.
The lightning is god's sword of retribution.
You talk as if you believed that black hogwash yourself.
The important thing is whether our friend in there believes it.
If he does...
You'll never break him with mumbo jumbo.
His kind understands only one thing:
Force.
- Kill him, you make a martyr of him.
- He'll be dead.
Hold it, Joe.
Go ahead, Henry.
You gotta fight an idea with a better idea.
With the help of this weather, and if I know my man...
Well, give me one more go at him.
Tell me, Ngai, if I do right.
I only wish to do thy will.
Give me a sign that I may know.
[SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
[IN ENGLISH] Lathela, get some kerosene and dry wood.
- I am not afraid to face god.
- We will see.
I am the messenger of god.
Did god create Mau Mau?
Mau Mau is the will of god.
Did god tell you to mutilate innocent children?
Did Gikuyu and Mumbi ever violate animals?
Since the creation of Mount Kenya has god ever told you to steal and murder and burn and hate?
Is it the will of god that you eat human flesh and blood?
- I swear that...
- Wait.
Let your swearing have value in the eyes of god.
Swear by your sacred Githathi stone.
Hold this symbol of God in your hands and swear.
Then I'll believe you.
Now begin at the beginning.
Did you ever take the Mau Mau blood oath yourself?
- No.
- I believe you.
- Did you give the oath to others?
- Yes.
- By force?
- Yes.
You swore to drive the white men out of Africa, didn't you?
- Yes.
- Did God tell you to create Mau Mau?
Say yes before God and I'll believe you.
I've said enough.
You are afraid to face your god.
- If Mau Mau drives us out, then what?
- Then freedom.
- And faith in god too?
- Yes, yes.
How?
What faith?
Mau Mau, the promise to murder?
Will god take back the people who've eaten the blood oath?
That's why you didn't take the oath yourself, isn't it?
Because you wanted to be able to come back to god.
Yes, Ngai, I come to you faithful with no other gods before you.
HENRY:
But you've broken every law of your god.
Tell him that too.
Tell him you gave the blood oath to others by night, by force.
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
These are the worst violations.
How can you lead your people back to god?
Even tonight, more of your people are being oathed banished from the house of god cursed to live through eternity as a broken-spined hyena.
Is that the future for your people?
Is it?
Is that what you want?
No.
Who's the oath-giver in Nairobi?
Who is he?
If god cannot accept Mau Mau, Mau Mau cannot lead your people.
In Nairobi, his name is Timbu.
Who gives the oath in Thomson's Falls?
Lorry driver for Bwana Wilson.
Nyeri?
They are even in the home guard.
Are Mau Mau in our telephone service?
- Yes.
- Code words for guns?
- Mti, tree.
- Ammunition?
Makaa, charcoal.
The McKenzie shamba, who led the attack?
The...
The husband of my daughter.
His name?
Kimani wa Karanja.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The capture of a high-ranking oath administrator has led to the arrest of many Mau Mau in the Nyeri District.
Loyal Kikuyu witnesses are cooperating by pointing out those Africans who have taken the blood oath.
Witnesses wear white hoods to conceal their identities.
Shantytown in Nairobi, cesspool of intrigue and resistance is being flattened and razed.
Ready?
- Where do you think you're going?
- To find Kimani.
GAME WARDEN:
I can't spare the men for that chase.
- Just Lathela and I.
- And when you find him, then what?
- Ask him to surrender.
- Why should he?
Because I know Kimani.
Because he wants peace as much as we do.
Peace?
You said surrender.
Peace means terms.
What terms?
His precious life?
A seat in parliament?
You and your pet black boy.
You're just a black liberator, aren't you?
GAME WARDEN:
All right, all right.
What terms?
The lives of his people.
- What can we lose by trying?
- Did this Kimani take the oath?
The old man says yes.
You wouldn't have one chance in a thousand of coming out alive.
MAN [OVER RADIO]:
The emergency operations now cost the government more than a million pounds every month.
Several farmers in the Nyeri District have quit their farms and returned to England.
Mau Mau gangs are being forced deeper into the Aberdare Mountains.
[GUNSHOTS]
HOLLY:
The flare, Papa.
Send up the flare.
HENRY:
Elizabeth.
[WHISTLE BLOWING]
Jeff.
Where's Jeff?
Tomorrow, you can take Elizabeth into Nairobi.
To the hospital.
And leave here?
It's to help Elizabeth.
We'll get you a little flat in town and you can come and see me every day.
Yes.
Yes, I'd like that.
Are you all right?
No one came here.
Did you make contact?
Well?
Did you see Kimani?
Will he come?
He's a big general now.
I do not know if he will come.
And if he come, I do not know if it is to speak or to kill.
I do not know how a general thinks.
KIMANl:
Put down your gun.
Kimani?
KIMANl:
The guns.
And the pistol too.
The pistol.
Now, tell Lathela to build a fire.
Why?
I want my comrades to see you.
We're alone, you have nothing to fear.
I know this.
You have tobacco?
- Cigarettes.
- Pass them here.
Why did you come?
- Can we not talk face-to-face?
- No.
- Njogu is our prisoner.
- I know.
He confessed many things, told us many names.
- I know.
- He is not harmed.
Then why did he turn against us?
Njogu was braver than any of us.
He was not afraid to die.
He was afraid for his soul.
Can you understand that?
Yes.
The people he named have been arrested.
- I know.
- You know the war goes badly for you.
It is possible to lose a battle and still win a war.
Must Africa always stink of death?
Can we not live together as friends?
- Friends have equal rights.
- They will come.
Only when we take them.
- I think we're ready to give them.
- What do you want of me?
PETER:
Give up.
Surrender.
Bring in your people.
Surrender?
Peace.
On what terms?
Justice.
Understanding.
If you stop fighting, others will do likewise.
You must have faith.
You must try.
We have tried before.
Then try again.
And again and again and again.
Do you not love anyone?
Your wife?
Children who believe in you?
You know of my child?
No.
A man-child?
Yes.
He will find a better world than you and I.
I sometimes dream of when we were children, you and I.
- Peter?
- Yeah.
I've not said that name in many years.
How goes it with your father?
As well as age will allow.
He was a good man.
He's a friend of my father.
Yes.
And Memsahib Elizabeth?
She is with child.
- Peter?
- Yes.
I did not hurt her.
I did not hurt her or her children.
It was not my hands that struck them.
I believe you.
What's happened to us?
When did this hatred begin?
Before we were born, I think.
I will talk with my people.
I will tell them that I trust you.
But they must decide for themselves.
This will take time.
Four days hence, you will have your answer.
If they agree we will come to the meadow by the hidden spring.
- You know of it?
- Yes.
- You will be there?
- Yes.
Until then.
Kimani.
Grandpa.
HENRY:
Peter.
- So you pulled it off.
- Yes.
- I wanna hear about it.
You like a drink?
- No, thank you, later.
Holly?
Holly?
Holly is with Elizabeth in Nairobi.
Oh...
- You see, we had another raid here.
- I know.
I asked her to go.
- Don't blame her, son.
She was...
- Thanks, Papa.
What we do is stupid.
To surrender betrays everything we have done.
Our children need food, our sick need medicine.
All we need is courage.
Let me talk to them.
You cannot talk to a starving people.
Their belly have no ears.
And if they shoot us down?
No, I have the word of my friend.
Your friend is a white man.
He hates us.
It is your own hatred that you see in others.
PETER:
Holly.
Sister Williams.
I called at your flat.
You shouldn't go into Elizabeth's right now.
Anything wrong?
No, she's just a little overdue, that's all.
There's nothing to be alarmed about.
You're looking...
You're looking thinner.
You don't look so bad yourself.
Was it very bad?
Some days are good, some bad.
- No, they'll see us.
- Let them.
Do you have to go back?
Tonight.
Oh, I wish I could go with you.
We'll go away soon in that honeymoon we never had.
We don't have to go away to be on a honeymoon.
But I thought you wanted to...
To run away?
Yeah.
HOLLY:
Just when was that?
Let's see, about a month ago?
At least a hundred years.
I want to go home to our home.
With Mount Kenya and God in the garden.
The war may not be over for a long time.
I used to blame the war for everything, didn't I?
Somebody else's war is always to blame.
No, I was to blame.
When you grow up, you realize you can't run away from the world.
You just gotta live in it.
You're a big girl now.
I'm beginning to understand about that other woman too.
- What other woman?
- Africa.
Oh.
She's not the least bit jealous.
And neither am I.
Excuse me.
Your boy, Lathela, he says you have to start off for somewhere or other.
PETER:
Thank you.
See you soon.
Please, God, let it be soon.
Can't you make this thing go faster?
We've got to get there by daylight.
Why?
It's almost impossible.
- But if Kimani shows...
- He set no hour.
He'll wait for us.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
- Matson?
- He got wind of it somehow.
You should have stopped him.
I only heard about him myself about an hour ago.
How do you keep a thing like this secret?
How do you keep Matson off the trigger?
This won't be any ceasefire, it'll be cold-blooded murder.
[PANTING]
[SLAP BABY CRYING]
Doctor?
Yes?
Is there any marks?
Just the mark of a man.
Look at this place.
It's a perfect trap.
What are we supposed to do?
Wait around till they show up?
MATSON:
We'd be caught in the open.
It's a perfect trap, I don't wanna get caught.
- If they show, it'll be to surrender.
- How do you know?
But they gave their word.
I'm taking cover.
You know how Joe is, always suspicious.
I know how Mau Mau is too.
Where is your friend?
You there, all of you, put down your guns.
[SCREAMING]
Wait.
Please.
[BABY CRYING]
[KIMANI SCREAMS]
[SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
Yeah, we lost him all right.
Come on.
[BABY MOANING CRYING]
- When we find Kimani, will you kill him?
- No.
Then why do we hunt him?
He must not think I betrayed him.
If he trusts us, others will do likewise.
If he escapes, if he does not believe Mau Mau will fight harder and longer.
Kimani will not surrender peacefully.
Not this time.
- He will try to kill you.
- Perhaps.
- Don't come along.
- I come with you.
- Why?
- This is my fight too.
Mau Mau has killed a hundred of my people for every one of yours.
I want the same thing for the African that Kimani wants.
Mau Mau is not the way to get them.
PETER:
Kimani?
Stay here and don't move.
And don't shoot.
- Let me talk to you.
- No!
You kill my wife and my people.
We were betrayed.
Both of us.
I'm here without a weapon.
Are you alone?
Lathela is here too.
I'm coming in.
Keep away.
Kimani.
[BABY CRYING]
[GRUNTING]
Don't make me do it.
Come back with me.
No.
We'll start over again.
- This time, it'll be different.
- No.
It is too late.
For you and me.
It is too late.
Must I kill you?
Yes.
[YELLS]
Give me the child and bury us both.
No.
Please.
He is dead.
- What will you do with the child?
- Take him home.
Elizabeth has a boy, raise them together.
Maybe for them, it'll be better.
It's not too late.

Pass!
Let's hurry!
Come!
Where is the farce Marcella?
- Marcello fortuneteller?
- Yes.
- You her friend?
- No.
Her brother.
You also guessing on a glass bowl and tea leaves?
If only, I do not believe that any penny.
In any case, things you better than mine.
My name Kvedchi.
- Not all the same call Duran.
By Romani which means "a fig."
Here's how!
Once I was an acrobat - I jumped from 12 meters into the bath.
A one night missed.
Since then - not worth a fig.
Keep.
I mended your pad.
Can you portray Lovelace evening.
I do not work the shoulder muscles more.
But the language works.
Maybe I'm lucky, and you tell me where I can find Marcello?
There.
The second trailer for the circus.
Thank you.
- What is this rogue?
- Bro Marcella.
Go and prosperous branch of the family.
So smartly dressed!
- Too!
Or a policeman or a thug.
But it expressed pretty well.
So bandit.
- Oh, it's you!
- Your joy is encouraging me.
How do I see you has kept the family tradition.
How do you come from?
From prison.
A little rest in 6 months.
Clutter, shorter.
I wonder, when will you grow up and poumneesh?
Change the record, okay?
Give the best drink.
The buffet has a wine.
Wait a minute.
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Fatigue.
Heart...
- No!
It is you not the weakest link.
You know, all of this - the word.
We fight, finding fault, but generally...
We love each other, no?
- Heck!
Here we are!
I need you, yes?
Yes.
I...
I would have to...
I have to hide for a few days.
But do not worry.
Do not the cops.
So much the better.
Because here strictly look after us.
Fair - is a disease of the gendarmes.
No one knows why.
How do you think you can get me a job?
You are not going to tell me that looking for a job?
Well, let's say, that was something to do.
It looks like you're in something cool vljapalsja!
I was in prison.
- Look, Bernard.
- Yes?
I do not play face-down.
I'm ready to be for you, but I need to know against whom?
I have already told you about my former friend - gang Richoni?
- Good buddy!
- I told you, the former!
They cranked a small business.
It is not weak.
We took a big jackpot - 14 million.
Wow!
Give me my pills.
There, in a box.
14 million - is hiding.
You - the shelter that I know.
You stole prey?
When you want to settle down, it takes money.
But do not worry, my friends about anything not guess.
Even the fact that I was known for their cache.
They are there, for sure, not see for several days, and during this time...
During this time?
I do not know, complications may occur, minor disassembly...
Accidents at work...
You sold them ?
!
I sell?
No.
Passed.
Do not you think the same, for the sake of the 14 million I will stand on ceremony?
14 million...
Can you imagine?
They will quickly realize which way the wind blows, if they have a head on their shoulders.
To get the moolah, they killed two agents and three passers-by.
So, believe me, my head on his shoulders at them - only temporarily.
The main thing that I could sit in the shelter,
Until they are caught.
- Money to you?
- Laugh or what?
- How much you give, if I help?
- What do you mean!
Will you take stolen money ?
!
You would divide wrongfully acquired?
Would deprive his brother ?
!
What about your sister?
You'll get as much as do.
Will not work, there is no fuel.
Okay.
Come descend to Cinco.
Let's go.
It is the owner of the circus.
And it is more than one, - he owes me money.
It's okay.
Just hoof ragged.
It is necessary to treat with ointment.
Or maybe to get started is to call the vet?
Vet?
And why not pedicurists?
Do you think I have little parasites on contentment?
Come on, shoo!
Take it from here.
But mother and Marcella.
Again, probably came to knock out money from the owner.
Who is she?
And it is quite personal.
This is your show?
Oh well!
Cinco!
A, Marcella, my beauty!
I'm always happy to see you.
Only you are not on time.
You just do not think I have my bad intentions.
Long for me - is sacred, but...
- I did not come here for this.
Do you still have no barkers?
- Yes.
And soon there will be nothing at all.
Things are deteriorating, people no longer go to the circus...
And you know why?
- Due to the television.
Exactly!
Circus offered to them right at home.
They baldeyut home with his family.
This is for him?
This is my brother, Fernand Bastia.
You do me a favor, if You take it.
It's hungry?
To work for me, you must be hungry.
Then consider that I'm hungry.
Well, if that's the manifestation of humanity - well.
And I know how to be grateful.
Just keep in mind - here you are not a farce.
It is necessary not only to be a greeter.
I must still be helpful.
And much work to do here.
And in response to the generosity of Cinco:
2000 francs per week, and grubs.
2000!
Are you kidding ?
!
You pay the guy the previous 5!
And nearly bankrupt, with such a breadth of US!
Do you want to take it or not.
- I take!
- Listen Cinco, can you...
- He has already agreed!
It you take a piece of bread!
You'll live with the acrobats.
Madeleine!
Take this guy for Dario.
Will live with him!
No, sit down, I'm going.
Well, we'll see you tonight?
Tell me, do you want?
Yes, after the closing.
But it's too late!
I can not walk after 10.
Okay, come when you want.
Something will think.
Oh, unwound, my mother is coming!
Lets go faster!
All the time an eyesore, and all the time with a servant!
All in father!
That did not stop my father to marry...
Society lady!
Gypsy acrobats - it's here.
This small palace!
You must have not often worked in the circus?
- Why?
- So, come to mind.
How long are you going to stay here?
Let's see.
What?
Nothing.
Just like that.
And why did you suddenly decide to come here?
I am looking for work.
So bad luck, you found it.
Way or not?
I am looking for work and found.
What is your name?
- Gina.
And this - my trailer.
Only with flowers.
Since then, as the Cinco cut staff, I live alone.
This has its cons and pros...
.
Dario?
Dario!
- What's the matter?
- Brought you a tenant.
Who else?
This brother Marcella.
Cinco hired him greeter.
Come here!
My name is Philip.
Philip Dario.
You surely have heard about me.
Of course!
Dario and Nellie - "The Ghost and Death"!
There is no more room.
- You did not tell Marcella?
- Yes, of course, I tell!
Okay, I'll leave you.
See you later.
Well, welcome...
Come!
Make yourself at home!
Your predecessor was sleeping on the right side,
If you have a preference or superstition...
No, no!
Take the couch, I will build on the cot.
I'm sorry, I have to go to work with Stella.
Stella - this is my daughter.
I'll explain it later.
Hey, Mom!
Mama!
What do you want?
Go keep an eye on the bench, I'll be right back.
The next...
Well, satisfied with their housing?
Oh, yes!
More than sugary hard to think!
Could get me anywhere else!
Where is it?
The trailer Marcella?
No...
I would have liked more than another.
Here is how?
What?
I do not know.
For example, the one with the flowers.
Beautiful colors, pleasant company and smells good...
For example, waking up in the morning, at breakfast...
- What do you eat breakfast?
- Coffee.
When I as a child - More and croissants.
What are you laughing at?
- You're just like a fair actor!
- Maybe belated vocation?
- Yeah, he can.
A can converge see your trailer?
No.
Not now.
- Gina...
- Gina, please!
- Yes!
- It's because I'm good,
I have to go.
Merchants closed at 7 o'clock.
There will be a bakery, there will be no croissants.
All this chatter!
He must be somewhere!
Good.
We here will not uyd置.
- So what?
- What?
A curtain!
It is nowhere seen.
- So he's hiding somewhere.
Thinly noticed!
I do not whether you think that it will be waiting for us on the terrace of a cafe?
Pour a mug.
- You've got the idea, Fredo?
They I have always, and it is ill-advised.
For ideas - as friends, they should not be too much.
Hello?
Yes, it's me.
Yes.
A?
What?
Yes.
Yes, I know!
Well, where is she?
Thank you.
You're a real friend!
What?
The name of his sister - Marcella fortune-telling.
Maybe he's hiding from her after the case in a villa in Neuilly?
Where she lives, this abnormal?
Powered by miserable fairs in provincial towns.
- These godforsaken full!
- Fredo!
You will not find a cigarette?
What if he did not go to his Sis?
Now, with attendants, that it may fall down abroad.
Well, call Jojo.
- All sorts of Jojo!
- Jojo, the little wagon!
- What's the matter?
- Police!
You bastard!
He passed us!
Open!
Police!
Yes, all right, go to sleep.
I have played so!
Brigade for the Protection of morality!
O, it happens with them.
Open.
They better not mess with.
- What is it?
- Open, gentlemen!
Ugolovka!
Hands up!
Hands up!
Well, Richoni?
What you say?
This time you got burned.
- Your informant still confused.
- Do not move!
- Oh, Fred!
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!
No way!
Shoot, guys!
Shoot anything that moves!
Let's go through the yard!
What are you!
They have there just waiting for you!
Bastards!
In the hatch!
Faster!
Surrender!
I give you 2 minutes!
Now you can not rush.
To taste?
- Okay, a splinter of glass.
There is a way out?
- Yes.
What about the others?
As you said, friends should not be too much.
Exactly.
- You're not good?
- Do not worry, everything is fine.
It would be nice.
Let's go!
Here!
Come executed by my 2000 francs!
Ladies and gentlemen, the idea that you'll see, ... This idea.

Just listen, as it should!
Come, ladies and gentlemen!
Come!

- Hi, Am?
d?
e.
- Hi!
Do you want some coffee?
No.
No, thanks, I already drank.
Listen, you do not have a newspaper?
Bulk!
And you do not have one, but...
today?
No.
I, you know, they just build up the fire, so...
Good morning!
Well, Dad, we do not work this morning?
Works.
But I had to repair the suspension strap.
Hey, yesterday I had no time to introduce you to Stella, my daughter.
We are preparing with a single number.
Number stunning!
- Well, Dad, are we going?
- We are going.
Listen, I want to walk.
You do not have another key?
Why?
What is there to steal?
Yes, of course...
Well, Dario, your tenant already awake?
Half...
Such a strange type.
I do not know what time he arrived yesterday.
Sleeps dressed.
Maybe he a lunatic!
Oh yeah...
View Gina tired.
Perhaps she, too, a lunatic?
You could have knocked!
I'm sorry.
Still, good morning!
What you happy - it's your courtesy, tenderness.
Well, you can not be the same day and at night.
Have to evening dance with the long sleeves.
You guided me bruises.
Do you want to tell you one stupid?
Well, tell me.
I really like you.
You do not have to answer me, in turn,
Maybe it was just a nice night, just for you...
I wanted to tell you...
I mean, if you want...
You would not mind every night dance with long sleeves?
Here!
Go!
Buy a newspaper, and then I'll give you an aperitif.
Welcome!
No, well, you see?
Once he has a grandmother, it can no longer shake hands?
If he had a grandmother, he would not have worked for Cinco.
I know what I'm saying!
I'll be right back.
Teach by heart?
What?
Article about the fight at Pigalle.
3rd time already read.
Well, everything ?
!
Are you at home?
Check the pockets?
We follow the mail?
Would wait until I take a subscription before removing the meter reading!
These are your friends?
- Who?
- Men with Pigalle.
Why are you hiding?
Who are you afraid of?
I perfectly see that you're scared.
- Where are you going?
- Where do I want to.
Imagine, I do not like the slap.
- Liar!
Oh, forgive me!
When I'm on edge, slap yourself frustrated.
Let's forget, okay?
You read that five were killed.
If you do not know them, why do you have such a person?
Because the other two.
Are you saying that you would be staged 7 dead?
You are strongly capable in the long run.
You got me with that thing!
END OF THE GAME
Do not be angry!
Let's go sit down.
I'll treat you.
Waiter!
- Mademoiselle?
- The same.
- Now!
Stubborn around, huh?
Okay, come on.
I'm listening to you.
You got into something bad, Fernand.
That's why you're here.
I do not want to know, you're right or not.
And even if you're wrong, I'm ready to be with you.
Oh!
Love - it is so beautiful.
Why do you say that?
Because you know that those types, which finished off, participated in the robbery of Marseille.
What the police did not find 14 million francs.
So you talk.
And since you are able to run, you divide 14 2.
Yesterday you took me for a bandit,
And you liked it.
Today you take me for a sucker, and you like it even more.
I had a good night, Gina, but...
Than 14 million.
I simply offer you my assistance.
Help to spend it?
- Here, Mademoiselle Gina.
- Write down, I'll pay tomorrow.
See?
Do you believe that everything has already happened.
Wronged?
- Not at all.
You too cunning for me, Fernand.
Talking to himself, and makes me tired.
I was fascinated, but wrong.
It happens.
Goodbye and good luck!
A pack of cigarettes.
Thank you.
Time is right, kids!
Hurry!
- But where is Jean?
- From Bastia, where else?
I feel sorry for Gina, she sunk down on a guy.
What is she in it found in this clown?
I do not understand.
If I were in your place, I would know what to do.
You have returned the money that I have a year must be his sister?
All work!
And with a soul!
And with enthusiasm!
Revenue today should be good!
You know my number with Stella
Ready.
This could save you.
- I know, I know.
- It is necessary to order the posters!
Oh, wait a minute.
Posters fine, but it is not important...
- They can be made in two colors.
- Yes!
For instance, I just thought...
What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.
- No!
Every time you're talking about one and the same, and I already told you "no!".
Why?
Because you suggest it to all the girls.
But others - this is nonsense, does not mean anything.
You see, I'm honest!
Why would I be honest?
Because I love you.
Yes, you know it.
- When love girl, her respect.
Oh, you're reading too much!
And this is life.
You're the only one I love.
Do you want to be the only one with whom I do not want to sleep?
No, it is illogical to do everything!
Leave me alone!
What if I talk to your dad?
But for now, if he catches you in his trailer, he kicks your ass.
If he agrees, I'll marry you.
At once.
And in the church!
White dress, green plants, red carpet.
And the gatekeeper!
Well, I agree?
- No!
- This is the same train!
- Yes, that's it!
I am too poor, right?
But if that's the case, you will be mine!
Bastia?
Come help me prepare tickets.
You then asked.
- Who?
I do not know.
The man who got out of the black car.
- What did he want?
- To find out whether you're here.
- He did not say anything?
- No.
Only that will see you later.
And... he looked like?
In your style.
The style that we do not like, let it be known.
Thank you!
Thank you very much, that I was warned.
- Where's he gone?
- To hell, I hope!
- Then who will drum up?
- You're, like yesterday.
You're right.
At the same time I will spare 2000 francs.
Even 5000 - I add myself a salary.
All the places for the parade!
Are you going to go?
We do not prevent, I hope?
Pepe feared hurt.
However, Pepe?
Yeah.
Ogonyok not find?
Yes.
- Read newspapers?
- Yes.
You with Pepe lucky.
- So we said, going here:
We lucky!
In our country such a friend like you!
You've always been decent, Fernand.
We walked, and said, "Fernand decent."
We were wrong?
- No...
I was sure that we can count on you!
We Pepe plans to leave, but not enough money.
You know life - without the money does not go far.
But...
I have no money!
That's why we're here.
To tell where to find them.
Or rather, it is to remind you.
I'm sorry, Fred, but I gave up.
The last six months I was stunned.
I decided to change my life.
- Well done!
It is necessary to give up the old life to doing good, huh?
You will have a pleasant memory.
And it will be nice to Pepe.
The money is still in a place that you know.
- I?
- Yes.
Converge zaber群h and come back.
What if I caught?
On Piga, certainly, full of cops.
Do you know them!
I mean...
Do you know how to behave.
And then - you did not participate in Marseilles, so... 14 million for four - This is good, no?
A for the three do not want to?
Yes, it is tempting...
But very risky.
From my pedigree, I can get 10 years.
Understand me, Fredo...
- I understand you perfectly!
Only Pepe will not be happy.
He told me: "If you give up the slack Fernand, I'll kill him!"
Pepe - he was.
But calm down, I'm here!
I have to reason with him.
Well, I'll tell him you agree?
- Yes.
- Grandmas are tomorrow night?
- Yes.
- Good.
For example, at 7 pm.
I'll give you half an hour of reserve.
Then - descends Pepe.
- Everything went well?
- Delicious.
- Well, what did he say?
- And what could he say?
- And you left him?
Go away?
- Yes.
And you'll stay,
Keep an eye on him.
- Trust me.
- If you want to know my opinion...
- I know him.
You do not have to say.
But what did he want?
Money.
But I'd rather die!
Do you hear?
I'd rather die!
- Maybe this is not the way out?
I behaved with you is disgusting.
You could throw me.
You're a good girl, Gina.
I understand it now, because I start to see more clearly.
Because you are satisfied with it.
Imagine that also suits me.
- Yes!
- Do not start.
How was I to guess that you have money?
I loved you with them or not.
It's called loyalty.
- Listen to me, Gina...
Are you kidding over all?
The parade finished, the greeter was me.
Can I now draw a dancer ?
!
Come on, shoo!
This circus does not suit me!
Now
- Mademoiselle Josiane, perfect woman!
When they have to go back?
- Tomorrow at 7.
- There is a time to collect the suitcases.
- Are you ready to quit the circus?
- Anyway, he soon he would leave me.
Where is the money?
- In the suitcase.
- A suitcase?
The cell storage in the North railway station.
We'll leave tomorrow morning.
And if you will follow me?
Decide that you went for the money.
The funny thing is that it's true.
Yes...
Or maybe you prefer that I went for a suitcase?
Yes!
Yes, I prefer!
You see, I trust you.
In this and the good of the family are being built.
And now it's my turn.
This is a farewell waltz.
Lovely Gina, the goddess of dance!
Do babes such a success!
Local public immediately legible.
It is a pity that we have to leave tomorrow.
- Direction
- North Station.
Direction
- Arches.
What do I do in the North Station?
Pick up the suitcase on the receipt, which you stole from me.
Brock!
- What did you call me?
Thy name!
I pulled a receipt storage.
Receipt, which I hid here under the table!
And that you come back to me!
Look, Bastia,
Your pukalki can not force me to give what I did not take.
Do not give you in the face with it, too, will be able to make not.
A and so will happen, if you would not uber群h.
Then I'm glad.
Do not be offended, I was joking.
- Never mind.
But you're wrong, kidding...
Such things.
Yes.
It's like a cigarette butt can start a fire!
Perhaps it would suit the owner.
Yes, but only if he paid the premiums.
Gina!
Come here.
What's the matter?
- My receipt of storage!
- So what?
I pulled it!
- Richoni?
- No, definitely not.
Then who?
We've got no thieves.
What are you talking about ?
!
In addition to the receipt, I stole all the money out of a suitcase.
And so - no thieves!
What a fool!
This morning I took out a shirt out of the suitcase.
And the money was there still.
So it happened recently?
What does it change?
All!
If you hurry, you still catch my thief at Gare du Nord!
Do you have money?
I do not.
Maybe you have Marcella?
You carry nonsense.
Perhaps Cinco?
He told me to pay for a few weeks.
You should in any run.
I'll come to you first train.
Wait for me at the hotel "Piccardi," you know?
- Yes OK.
Fernand!
Yes?
If you return the money, we will go to Italy.
If you deceive me, I shall hand you to the police.
You clear favorite?
You are not as good as I thought, Gina.
Do not "is not so good." Not such a fool.
Okay, go.
If tonight everything goes well,
We will be able to pay taxes, for the light, and we can go tomorrow.
- To pay all the salary?
- If all pay, we will not go away.
I do not need anything Dario, fortunately.
He's an artist.
Madeleine - too.
Dame illusionist a little money, that's all.
And so well.
My poor Royal.
In such circumstances, we hold out long.
If Dario number will be successful, we will be able to get out.
This is our last chance.
- Phantom.
Cinco!
What do you want?
- Money!
- You're on time.
Cinco, I'm serious.
I have to leave.
- With the strikers?
- Yes.
Right now, Gina, I can not.
But in the evening, after the presentation, I will try.
But it's not great - throw us in a moment.
Sorry, Cinco.
I would have stayed, but I can not.
The rats are leaving the ship.
Hey, little girl, let's go have dinner.
Can not find your number 3968.
Perhaps it has already taken.
Yes, but...
You do not know who?
How should I know?
I atonement for service in 8 hours.
What's more, I could not give you your suitcase without a receipt!
And you tell me, as your colleague who works during the day, - where is he?
At home, I guess.
But if you think that he will be able to remember the customer...!
We then give out per day more than one thing, so...
- Hey, please!
- Yes, I'm coming!
Sorry, sir.
- Everything happened?
- Nothing like this.
Marcella must leave.
She needed all of her money.
What kind of selfish!
- But we still be able to leave?
Leave something we can always.
Depends only, under what conditions.
Any day fly off the vultures, hawks...
Hawks?
Bailiffs!
Do you think they will take my horse?
These people take everything.
Straw and logs, stairs and clocks, machinery and horses...
It Attila of our time!
Log in!
What do you want?
Nothing!
I was passing.
Well, Marcella sent you to hell?
- How do you know?
- To eavesdrop.
I'm always eavesdropping.
- Anyway, you're honest.
- I am glad that you found my dignity.
This will facilitate the work.
Cinco!
You are sitting on the rocks.
- Not at all!
Daughter you hard worker.
But you're still sitting on the rocks!
You already said that.
So what?
But if there was a guy, a good guy in all respects,
Which will accumulate?
What can you offer him?
- You know this guy?
- What can you offer him?
- Well... circus.
Number of Stella and Dario is almost ready.
International Class!
You can repeat it without laughing?
Horse Josiane.
Horse Mademoiselle Josiane!
With or without a rider?
- Nahal!
What do you mean?
I mean that is the only guarantee - if I become your kinsfolk.
I want to marry, and you need money.
I'm getting your son in law, and you save a circus.
For the salvation of the circus, my Kvedchi, you need a lot of money.
I have.
- And cash!
- Yes, I have.
And where?
You know, after my accident I embraced you.
I won.
Yes - compensation, disability benefits.
400 thousand!
What do you say to this, father?
Josiane,
You're already an adult girl, almost a woman.
A woman was not created to live alone.
I do not marry Kvedchi!
What you are discussing here is disgusting!
Is that you talking with her father so ?
!
Strange you raised it.
If I knew...
Sidi.
Why do you refuse Kvedchi?
As it has charm.
- Oh, yes!
And this charm he gives everything.
No one skirt missed!
Does it good!
Well, nothing can be done, Kvedchi.
I thought you were serious fellow.
Take your money.
Circus, certainly will not,
But my daughter will be happy.
I am happy with the ruined and robbed her father.
In the living corpse!
Television remove him hide,
Bailiffs will get seeds.
We beg, my girl.
But most importantly, I make you happy.
- Oh, come on, Dad, please!
I agree.
I agree, if Kvedchi promise me that...
Oh, yes!
I swear!
Hide grandmother!
- This is Gina.
- A, you can discover!
- Good evening!
- Good evening.
- Well, okay!
Till tomorrow.
- Till tomorrow.
- You asked to come in the evening.
- What is said is said.
How much do I owe you?
Today is...
34 thousand francs.
Wow!
- Hold.
With a small premium.
Yes, it's a fortune!
In life there are ups and downs.
At the moment - soon rise.
- Borrowed?
- Rodney.
In vain you are leaving us on the rise.
Can I still and will be back.
Thank Cinco.
Gina!
So, is it true?
Are you leaving us?
- Tomorrow I leave.
- With the strikers?
Yes.
Where are you going?
In another place.
It's because of those guys that came?
Cinco you paid?
It's wonderful, it has money - burn!
I know.
This is Marcella.
Once they slept together.
And she always had a weakness for him.
Marcella?
Can not be!
I'm telling you!
Goodnight Kvedchi.
Monsieur!
Monsieur!
- Who's there?
- You are asked to phone.
You call from Provence.
You can pick up the phone.
Hello?
Hello, yes?
Yes, yes, it's me.
Waiting.
Hello?
It is on the phone.
He got a call from Mersevalya, Marsevalya...
Stay here.
Yes, hello?
Is that you, Gina?
No, no, nothing happened.
I am late.
How is it not scary?
Yes.
And so, you are not thieves!
What?
How to...
Cinco ?
!
A lot of money?
Do you think you can still fix it?
Yes, it is.
Okay, I'm going.
Keep.
So will converge.
Wait, that's not all.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Here.
Up to 9 hours, you call the number 7 in Marsevale.
And leave this message to Mr. Roland.
"Sending will Marsevale this morning."
"Suitcase was not present in the cold."
Rely on me.
- Well, call me a taxi.
Well, mademoiselle.
Now the flowers?
Yes, flowers.
For Josiane.
- So this is serious?
What?
I told you that it will be mine.
She is mine.
Well... almost.
I wonder what made her change her mind?
- My lovely manners.
- Your manners!
What are these two again come to do here?
Do you know them?
Then be engaged in their business!
What do I do!
It comes back, but no money.
- I am surprised that he returns.
- Maybe he likes trouble.
Go.
- I was in a hurry.
- I also.
Nice to hire?
We thought that you're tired, because the car drove.
Fernand!
What?
Send it.
Fernand, be kind.
- If you do not fall behind, I'll scream.
- I shoot.
- If you think I'm scared...
- As if I'm going to shoot you!
- Leave it, Gina, this is a misunderstanding.
- How cute!
Let's hope not the last.
Fredo, you must listen to me!
Of course, Fernand, we are here to do just that.
I do not dare to go for the money.
At the last moment I was afraid that the police monitors the cafe.
You is surely arranged.
As they watched the cafe, they have not followed the North Station.
Fredo, you're wrong!
- You think I'm guilty.
And I - a victim!
- Misunderstandings.
I know.
The only misunderstanding between us - I perceive you as a man.
I wanted to give you a chance.
You look like you could not use it.
- I was robbed of a receipt storage.
- It's impossible.
- I swear his eyes, Fredo!
- Look, Fernand,
You have passed the cops.
It is still possible to settle.
We all forget.
But the favor.
The money we need.
- But I'm telling you...
- And we'll get them.
Even if you have to pull out of the bills one by one.
But this - work for Pepe.
I'm telling you, I stole it!
I stuck it under the table.
We have a lot of time, Fernand.
Maybe you want to work Pepe?
I'm telling you I do not know anything!
- You're stubborn!
- Yes.
Everything is ready.
Are you comfortable?
Yes?
Good feeling?
Where is the money?
I would, perhaps, have learned if you trusted me.
Listen, give me time, I'll find a jug.
What are you risking?
It Again we throw!
I assure you, he can!
- Fuck you!
Pepe!
Calmly.
You should not tease him.
Where is the money?
Hell, Fred, if I knew, why would I come back?
In order for us to kill you!
I do it?
- While Turn to the machine.
Turn around.
We're going back to the circus.
It blockhead!
You can only help me!
I now know the circus.
Take me back,
And I swear I will settle everything quickly.
What do you think?
I think that you are too diligent.
Forget the circus, I will do everything for you.
Especially not flutter.
I just I will go and have a look and come back immediately.
Admit it, it would be a shame to die so young, with hoarded money?
- You leave Pepe?
Recklessly!
- Recklessly would leave him.
- I?
- Today you will work in a new way.
- You think so?
- Language, for a change.
- Do you have a candle?
- Yes.
How old are you?
Packaging.
And the matches.
No, the big boxes.
Please, sir.
With you 290 francs, monsieur.
Gina!
Gina!
So you did not go?
- As you see.
So you stay with us?
- Maybe...
- I am very happy.
Listen,
I go from Arsha.
Everything is settled, we're leaving tonight.
- Give me your jeep.
- You crazy?
- Give me your jeep!
- What does all this mean ?
!
Listen Cinco, all very serious!
A petrol - is also seriously?
I'll pay.
And be careful!
Strongly do not chase!
She left on your wheelbarrow!
Why did you give her?
Dahl gave!
I had time to give her?
Do not you see?
Log in!
- It is you - the owner's daughter?
- Yes.
Let me introduce myself - Angela Lombardi.
I said, your clicker left?
Maybe I could replace it?
- You ?
!
- Why not?
I started peddler under the counter on the boulevards.
And then, I have always loved the circus.
Monsieur.
Mademoiselle ready to replace the strikers.
I'll be glad if go up.
These pretty girls can not come.
But I can offer only 1000 per week.
More I did not ask.
I ran, Kvedchi waiting for me.
Goodbye, Mademoiselle.
- Goodbye.
- It's too good to be true.
Two days of work, and then...
- Let's see.
Agreed?
- Agreed.
Come later.
I will teach you the science barkers.
Intricacies of the profession.
It is an art!
Thank you!
You can sit down?
Do not worry.
- What You take?
- I do not know.
Coffee with cream.
Do you want to eat?
They then very tasty sandwiches.
No, thanks, I'm not hungry.
- Coffee with cream!
- Coffee with cream.
When we get married, we'll be there every day in the cafe.
How rich.
And yet, you know, I thought about our honeymoon.
We're going to Venice.
There's so wonderful in Venice!
How?
- I still have not been there...
- Does not matter, tell me!
Well, first, we make love in a gondola...
O Kvedchi!
- What?
- Well, let's say.
And then?
- And then...
- Expensive Cognac in the big glass.
- Okay, sir.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
- Want uyd置?
- No no.
- All right, I was hired.
- Well done!
You were fast.
Yes.
Now you have to find a guy who suspiciously quickly become rich.
Who is spending right and left.
You know what I mean?
I understand.
It's probably a whore, and I do not want her here.
I think her dad has already hired.
I tell you that he will dismiss it, and together with Gina!
But Gina had gone.
She left and came back.
And even stole your father's jeep.
Our jeep!
Do you like crabs in the pot?
A string beans...
love?
"Very fine"...
You are pampered!
Yes, but...
If you want to nibble on, will have to begin to sit at the table.
How funny!
When I want, I'm so merry!
Well,
Figured you about money?
I asked the question!
- Yes.
That's what I'll tell you:
If Fredo and his woman would find the money,
Them and they run away.
And some will remain with the nose - and it's you!
- You think?
- Yes.
How to drink to!
Fredo left you here to his hands were free.
But... the case is not yet completed.
You do untie we rush back, I'm taking the money,
And we divide them into two.
- You're going to work with me?
- Yes.
I had been thinking about it.
- ABOUT!
Well, Fernand, I here you simply hold oaf!
Cigarettes do not want?
I want.
- I do not have pockets, and I do not smoke.
- I have.
Here, in the pocket.
Tell me,
Who's there?
Do not be nervous, dear.
It's great, is not it?
You want to know who's here, right?
Now you know it.
- Gina!
- You start talking?
Gina!
Do Cinco never had any money.
And now - there.
According Kvedchi he gave Marcella.
Fortune Teller?
Sis Bastia?
Yes.
But it is certainly not true.
- Well, hang out.
Marcella had nothing to do with it!
You bastard!
So you gave the money to her Sis?
You're crazy!
Be polite!
Will be explained with his maid.
I believe her.
Fredo also believe!
You are one against.
And you're out of the game!
- Look, Pepe, I can help you!
You do not leave me here to die alone!
You're not alone here.
Madam - the neighborhood.
Lucky!
Hey!
Repeat.
- Okay, sir.
- How are you doing?
- At zero.
I put out the door.
It seems that fear of something.
Every fear, then there is a reason.
I'm sure that something was there.
- Could buy me a beer!
- Get fat from it.
- What's Your Number?
- 900 thousand!
I left 2 more ball.
I'll become a millionaire!
Yes.
Here the fair roaming gunmen.
You they probably know.
Who's on the phone?
Interrogate circus acrobat Dario,
More and Gina, a dancer.
But who are you?
Answer!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello...
You'll say, old owl ?
!
Will you speak ?
!
Will you say, vile creature ?
!
Hell!
- You know the kind of Dario?
- Of course, it is our acrobat.
- Where is he?
- Probably in his trailer.
The first right.
- Thank you.
- What do they want from Dario?
- This is probably due to Bastia.
From such people - always nothing but trouble!
Dad!
Where is Dad?
- What happened?
Marcella!
It's not moving!
I think she's dead!
Well, it just is not enough...
- This is certainly the heart deposited.
- It was in the evening departure!
- Your mother's looking for you, Kvedchi!
- You do not work, she is angry.
Okay, I go.
Here is a gift!
- She has always had a weak heart.
- I say that there is filthy!
It is, for sure, mutila with his brother.
- With a guy that was a greeter?
- Yes.
Doctor she is no longer needed.
So, parted, move!
You go out there!
Fast!
- What did I tell you!
- Maybe it's her brother?
This is murder!
She kept the house all your money!
I think it strangled.
She has marks on her neck.
Call to the site, let people send.
Yes, chef!
Expenses on a trailer!
All forbidden to leave the area of the holidays!
This is murder!
- I told you!
- I have long sought.
Yes.
Only you - not a policeman.
4 dead man in Marseilles, 5 - at Pigalle.
Who is next?
If the case begins with a fight, a fight over it.
- What do we do?
- I
- I do not know, and you - to collect the suitcase.
- You want me to leave?
- So you escaped.
We are going to fight, I feel.
A is not a ladies' game.
Rate - 14 million, and we have something to lose.
So I prefer you to leave the game.
We are all divided into two.
May, will continue?
Years in prison for two is not divided.
When the motley your age gets 10 years - this is the end.
Are you ready for 10 years wearing a gray robe and slippers tinkering?
I do not care.
Do not say that.
As long as you have the conscience of nothing.
Or almost nothing.
And tomorrow everything is going to be different.
Return to Paris and wait quietly.
Calmly wait what?
Exhaust itself?
Ask yourself, have arrested you or not?
Ask myself, what I bring, - oranges or flowers.
Shut up!
For fun you have to pay.
Life - is a journey.
I would like to go first class.
I have always loved silk shirts and shoes made to order.
And I have not traded in a row, it would be illogical.
- What's the matter?
- It's me!
Discover!
I thought I told you to go back and wait there?
Disaster struck, Fredo.
Chick Fernand came to explore, and I...
I caught it.
She uttered a few words about Marcello.
That she was involved.
More.
You went to Marcelle?
Yes.
To ask her any questions.
It is necessary to pass the buck, Fredo!
- Wait a minute!
Marcella?
Marcella!
I assure you, I have nothing to do with!
In her heart she refused.
Fredo, you're...
You do not leave me?
Where do I, in your opinion, go?
Where do you want.
To the Greeks.
Okay.
Then I will come back to the villa.
I left them there either.
Then finish them off for a full set.
Will you come, Fredo?
You do not leave me?
- No.
I will ask the President himself, so he put us together for the company.
Why did he kill her?
Misunderstanding, as it said Fernand.
Protracted misunderstanding.
Pepe was too stupid, Fernand - too cunning.
Police will be here soon.
It's time to disappear.
I?
You go back to Paris.
Come from time to time in the "In Field".
I'll leave it to you the news.
If all goes well.
Here's yet to wait.
No.
They you more useful.
This is unlikely.
The car, for sure, in the search.
What are you going to do?
- I'll go as soon as possible.
Either way, if I do not go down after 5 minutes they will rise.
Next!
Stop!
Stop or I'll shoot!
What?
Turns?
- Minute!
I sang this number 3 years ago Karpatto.
Pepe - a professional, and I have lost the knack.
My poor!
- Well, hurry up!
What are you naplela about my sister?
I'm not used to me about extinguished cigarettes.
In general, I would have passed anyone but you.
What's more, I just repeated what I was told.
- Who?
- Kvedchi.
Git!
- You think this is it?
- Definitely!
It's okay.
Stagnant blood.
It will pass.
How did you get here?
I follow you on a jeep owner.
Keep.
- With "Hold"?
Popey.
That's it.
Come on.
Bastia foul!
Bastia was blown away!
They still know enough!
Come on.
- Listen!
In minutes as the score goes!
No.
Do not for a minute.
It can wait.
Oh, you... you bastard!
Yes, it can wait!
He accused me of stealing receipts from storage.
He even guided me the gun.
Bring it in a report.
What's next?
Nothing.
He saw that I was not to blame, and calmed down.
Okay, good.
We have already moved.
The owner of the circus - are you?
Go.
You can be free.
But do not leave your trailer.
You must have a fortune of money?
- Yes.
So what?
If I had to kill all those who I have money,
You would have to double the staff.
- We can disagree?
- That's really not!
Well that ended this market?
I think they are looking for a suitcase.
Will conduct searches.
- By what authority?
- I do not know, but it's true.
Let there be sought!
The one who searches will find!
The search...
The search...
The search...
Stay here.
Hey, there!
Where are you?
Someone looking for?
Get down.
No, I...
I have come to my sister.
- Ah, the fortune-teller - your sister?
- Yes.
Well, okay, I go to next time.
Show me the documents!
The one who searches will find...
And find what?
Kvedchi!
Those guys!
Those guys will not find!
Those guys!
Hey, Kvedchi, open the door!
What are you doing, Kvedchi?
Tell me!
You open it or not ?
!
Are you crazy?
Why do you close?
- It is necessary.
Carriages will be searched.
What's burning?
Yes, it's money!
- This is mine, do not touch!
It is mine!
Money!
Do not touch the money!
They curse!
Yes, leave the money!
They curse!
Gimme!
Give it to me!
Thanks to you, give here!
I tell you, it will be searched!
If they find us...
Exploded gas cylinder?
- It's in Kvedchi!
- Faster!
Faster!
Do not approach!
Get away!
Here it is dangerous!
Save yourself!
Caution!
Caution, Fernand!

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
There's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I've got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End

Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Yourjacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
There's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd betterjoin us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don'tjust sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don'tjust stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools then the children are fools
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Boris is working day and night.
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Verónica.
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement.
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders..
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma..
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down..
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee..
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee....
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside..
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there..
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding..
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline....
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once..
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well....
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!

Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!

You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, with long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".
THE CRANES ARE FLYING
Written by V. ROZOV
Directed by M. KALATOZOV
An Order of Lenin Film Studio "Mosfilm" production, 1957
Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Verónica.
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I don't know.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself, you know?
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement.
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders...
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma..
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down..
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee...
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march.
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside...
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there...
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding...
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the hell I've got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
- I'm doing all right as a girl.
- Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave me alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse?
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
Here you are.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
Feodor?
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
a harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
a harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 2 4 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 3 26 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
Stop, Squirrel.
Put them on.
Look!
"Cranes like ships, sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones With long beaks they fly"
Look, look!
There you go.
You and your "cranes like ships."

Who's there?
Wait.
Well, okay.
When?
- Thursday, at the embankment.
- Come on, that's too long!
Squirrel!
We haven't finished.
Squirrel!
When?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't.
I'll be at the factory.
Okay.
Don't be late!
Squirrel!
She's crazy about him.
And he about her.
That's what love is, my dear:
A harmless mental illness.
Why aren't you in bed yet, Grandma?
It's already time to get up, Boris!
Quit making noise!
Running around all night...
You're just jealous.
Did you tear it?
Your jacket's all in one piece.
Disgraceful!
Twelve o'clock, and he's still asleep.
He works a lot.
He's tired.
Let him at least get some sleep on Sunday.
This "work" of his will end in a wedding.
You're just afraid of losing him.
Irina's mind should be on her thesis, not on a wedding.
Watch out, Uncle Fedya.
She almost has her doctorate and you're still just a physician.
Well, if children don't surpass their parents, then the parents are bad and the children not much better.
Thanks, Mama.
Important announcement!
What's going on?
Boris!
War!
You hear me?
War!
Leave me alone.
Hello.
Boris is at the factory day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica.
In wartime, it's important not to lose your head.
Try to live a normal life.
Like me...
I dream of dedicating a piano concerto to you.
Will you come to hear it?
- Won't you be drafted?
Drafted?
I don't know.
I doubt it.
And why is that?
The most talented people will be exempt.
- And you suppose you're talented?
- Yes.
Why are you always following me around?
You ought to be ashamed.
I am.
I promised myself a thousand times I wouldn't.
I know Boris is my cousin, but I can't help myself!
You understand?
I can't.
Wait!
There's no need to escort me.
Watch out!
You'll hurt your leg.
It'll be harder at the front, my dear Boris.
They won't let you go to the front.
There will be only one exemption.
Either for you or for me.
That's right.
So you should stay.
You've got knowledge and experience.
And you've got something more important... talent.
Take care of your drawings.
You know, my wife's already got my bags packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready!
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
Well?
Where's the notice?
Nothing yet.
I don't understand why they're so slow.
Are you going home?
- No, I'm...
- Oh, I see.
Well, say hello to her!
- I will.
What?
- Have you told her?
- No.
Why should I rush it?
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Take care!
- Let go.
- I won't let go.
You're gonna fall!
Let go.
You'll tear the shade.
- It's a blanket.
- Let go.
I'll call the police.
- I'm tired of these blackouts!
Give it to me!
- You're gonna fall.
- I am not.
Squirrel, stop it.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- So?
- He's handsome.
So?
- Are you jealous?
- What?
- Are you jealous?
- I don't have the time.
Too bad.
I think I'll enroll at the Architectural Institute.
- They won't accept you.
- Yes, they will.
I doubt it.
Cranes like ships sailing in the sky
White ones, grey ones with long beaks they fly
Do you like my song?
Very profound.
Little croaking frogs Why didn't you look up?
You kept on hopping and jumping That's why you got eaten up
Eaten!
Well, hero, did you win?
I won, I won.
I won.
Do you think you'll be drafted?
- Of course.
- Would you volunteer?
- I might.
No, you won't!
You know very well you'll be exempt.
That's why you talk so big.
- What makes you so sure?
- I know.
All the smart ones will be exempt.
So only fools will fight?
I don't want to discuss it any further.
Veronica...
I want to talk to you about something.
Well, I don't.
And please don't call me Veronica.
Who am I?
- Squirrel.
- That's right.
Listen.
What will you give me tomorrow?
It's a secret.
If it's something good to eat, I'll eat it and forget about it.
Give me something I will always remember, for as long as I live.
Kiss me.
You know, when you're with me,
I'm not afraid of anything, not even the war.
I'm afraid of the police.
Veronica.
You know what?
Do you know?
For the wedding I'm going to make a white dress.
Like the one my grandma had.
And a long, long veil.
And you'll wear a black suit, and we'll go...
- To the registry office.
- Agreed then?
- Agreed.
You know, I like this blackout.
What's so good about it?
Hey!
Stepan!
I have a treat for you.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Did it arrive?
- It did.
Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
Things are crazy at the factory!
The guys ran to the barber's.
I went straight to your place.
- Make it short.
- Just wait.
So I was saying, the guys ran...
Listen, can't you make it shorter?
- Your family's worried.
- What time do we report?
Today at 5:00.
With your things.
Look at these cherries.
- What is it?
- Beautiful.
The notice came.
Really?
For you?
Yes, for me too.
We both volunteered.
What?
You volunteered?
But the notice came...
Wait.
What about me?
I'd better go home.
I've got a lot going on there too.
Squirrel.
I didn't want to tell you.
Tomorrow's your birthday.
I have to go.
Of course.
Squirrel.
What's the matter?
Cranes like ships
You like my poem?
Nothing will happen to me.
You hear?
And then you and I will live for a long, long time.
A hundred years.
Go.
We'll say good-bye later.
All right.
Don't be late.
Can't he stay home until tomorrow?
He's a swine if he's still at Veronica's.
Boris!
- Did Dad call?
- Yes.
He's furious.
Why didn't you tell us?
To avoid scenes like this.
Go to the factory tomorrow and turn these over to Kuzmin, the engineer.
I will, I will.
What are you stuffing in there?
I'm running out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute.
Will they send you to the front right away?
Probably.
Here... wait a minute.
Early tomorrow morning take this to her.
What is it?
It's her birthday tomorrow.
And later, if things are hard for her...
After all, this is war...
Help her out.
And if I die?
You've got no business dying, especially now that you know so many secrets.
I just might up and die.
Quiet.
That's Veronica.
No, it's Irina.
Thank God, you're home.
Boris!
Come over here.
What is this about?
You're 25 years old and you...
forgive me... act like a fool!
What are we?
Children?
Is this a game?
Hide-and-seek?
He wants adventure!
There's character for you.
Where are Irina and Mark?
Irina's making coffee.
Mark went out to buy some wine.
Coffee, wine!
What's wrong with people these days?
Irina!
Bring me the bottle from the medicine cabinet.
Boris!
Come here.
Where's Veronica?
- She'll be here any minute.
- Where is she?
She's busy.
This isn't right.
She should be here.
Her fiancé is leaving.
I'm not her fiancé.
- What are you, then?
- We're just...
You're just what?
That sounds suspicious.
- I don't mean it that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Stop picking on me.
- Wait!
- Why are you bothering him?
- Here.
From the medicine cabinet.
- Go ahead and mix it properly.
- Here's the port.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a real drink.
So, is everybody here?
Sit down.
It's Veronica!
Go meet your bride, Mr. Bridegroom!
Finally!
- We came from the factory to see Boris.
- Please come in.
And I thought the bride had arrived.
- We're from the plant.
- They told us to bring you these gifts.
Sorry.
This one.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee...
- And the Communist Youth League...
What you want to say is:
"Comrade Boris, fight to the last drop of blood, and beat the fascists!
And we at the plant will meet and exceed our production quotas."
We've heard all that before.
Why don't you sit down with us, girls, and drink to my son Boris!
Things in this world aren't going as smoothly as we might like.
So now you're off to war, Boris...
- Let's have a drink!
- To you!
A glass for Grandma.
We sent our brother off yesterday.
Mother cried and cried.
What about you?
- I cried too.
- On behalf of the Plant Committee?
- No, on my own.
- Don't embarrass her.
We've got no one to send off.
There's just Mother and three girls.
We even felt a little ashamed, with all the others leaving...
When our men come back, you'll envy us.
The trouble is not all of them will come back.
For those who don't, we'll build a monument reaching to the sky with every one of their names in gold.
Irina, pour another round.
What are you waiting for?
I'll just put these away.
Well, you folks in the rear, meet and exceed your quotas!
Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, don't go.
Stay with Father.
- I'll walk you to the trolley.
About face!
Guards, forward march!
- Mother!
- The last time.
I'm sorry.
Not in the mood for a drink?
Where are you going?
- I'm going on duty.
You were on duty yesterday.
Varvara Kapitanova, may I see Boris for just a moment?
- He already left.
- He left?
Where did he go?
- To the assembly station.
- Oh, no.
- Come in.
- Where's the assembly station?
- I don't know.
- What's this?
- It's from Boris, for your birthday.
There's a note too.
- Where's the note?
- Isn't it there?
He must have forgotten in the rush.
Forgotten?
He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's the assembly station?
- It's on Zvenigorodskaya.
Don't worry.
She'll come.
Even if she does, how will she find me in this crowd?
What are you doing?
Boris, where's Veronica?
Write to me every day.
Who has the invoices for the cauliflower?
Don't forget to send your field address.
Cheer up, pug-nose!
Take care!
Fall in!
She'll come.
Boris!
Fall in!
Forward march!
There's my kitten.
Grandma?
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Anything?
- No.
Oh, this war.
Well, rain or shine, we must carry on.
Have you decided where you'll work?
I'll go to the war factory.
Citizens!
Air raid alert!
Hurry down to the subway.
I've got some urgent work to do.
Go get your things.
Where's the backpack?
- The backpack?
It's right there.
I won't go without you.
If it becomes dangerous, we'll go down to the shelter.
Go now.
Be careful in the subway.
She's so scared, poor girl!
- What about you?
When Veronica is safe and you're by my side, I'm not afraid.
They're still at it, the brutes.
Those parasites won't even let us talk!
For some reason he doesn't write to me.
It's the war.
The mail is so slow.
All clear.
The air raid is over.
Let's go.
Well, my place is right here.
If you decide to come join us, call me at the factory.
- Okay.
- Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Get back!
Where do you think you're going?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you'll stay with us from now on.
Boris' room is free for now.
Mark will share a room with Fedya.
Mark, we must take good care of her.
Unfortunately, Irina and I are at the hospital day and night.
I'll try, Uncle Fedya.
Boris spoke to me about it.
Are you all right now?
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin, please?
He's gone to the front too?
Excuse me.
Is there any news from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for the damned war,
I'd be playing this at Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- That's nonsense!
Let's go.
- Are you afraid?
Only for your sake.
Come on, let's go.
I'm not afraid of anything.
Veronica, let's go!
Don't be foolish.
You're acting crazy!
I won't go!
I won't, I won't, I won't!
I love you.
No.
I love you.
I love you.
I love you!
- Go away!
I love you.
What a stupid way to get surrounded.
- Stepan, stop whining.
- What do you mean, stop whining?
The captain said we might break through by tonight.
- At last!
Sachkov!
- Here!
Where's this rookie from?
Straight from an incubator.
A fresh reinforcement.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that any way to speak to a married man?
- Is that right?
- I got married in school.
See what education does to people.
You funny guys, always joking!
Laughed yourselves right into a trap.
Volodka, are you really married?
Are you kidding?
Sounds better, though, doesn't it?
Borozdin!
You'll go out on reconnaissance.
Your job is to find the best place to break through.
Turn over your papers.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Come on, help me here.
Let's take a break, guys, and have a smoke.
She's always laughing like that.
- They must think we're dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Yep, the life of a soldier.
You're over here, and she's...
And she's what?
Give me the harmonica.
Sachkov, hold it for a second!
Stop it!
Aren't you ashamed?
- No.
Five days' arrest.
You'll both go on reconnaissance.
Turn in your papers.
Boris, here.
Because of her?
She's worth fighting for.
- Exactly.
Stop that chatter!
Discipline!
Hear that?
Discipline.
Stepan, hold on to this.
Just don't lose it.
We're getting married, Uncle Fedya.
I forgot...
I still have some sausage.
- Keep your head down.
- Stop giving me orders.
- Let's get out of here or they'll get us.
- Run if you're scared.
You idiot!
Hey, you!
Musician!
You deaf?
How the hell did I get stuck with him?
What's wrong?
Hey, you!
Go on alone.
I want to rest for a bit.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
Hold on to me, I said, and hold on tight!
Here, get on my back.
It'll be faster this way.
Leave me here.
- Idiot!
You're sore because I punched you.
- You were just lucky l...
Shut up.
We'll settle it later.
Hold on, hold on.
A little further to the woods, and then we're safe.
I'm tired.
Let's rest a bit.
It's quieter here.
So, are you alive?
- It's a little hard to breathe.
- To breathe?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter?
Forgive me.
Forgive me.
Forgive me, friend!
Hey, somebody, help!
Help!
Help!
Boris!
What's wrong, Boris?
Are you wounded?
I'm not wounded.
I...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports no important changes on the fronts in the last 24 hours.
No important changes.
That's good.
Families evacuated with Moscow Plant 326 will be quartered on Vostaniya Street.
Comrades, report here.
Irina, help this wounded man.
- The paramedics will be here soon.
- Yes.
Unload!
Siberia.
We can't retreat much farther.
This is what's become of Mother Russia.
Attention, attention!
Chief of Hospital Number 4, Borozdin, report to the military commandant.
Perhaps we'll find some peace here.
Clear the way, folks.
The stove is smoking.
I'm sorry.
You can daydream when the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
She's always waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's right here.
Not like us, soldiers' wives.
She's not waiting for a letter from anyone.
- Are you on the second shift at school?
- Yes.
"Cranes like ships sailing in the sky."
Those silly lines are stuck in my head.
There it is.
- What?
The mail.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- Veronica, this is crazy.
...16, 17, 18, 19 20, 21...
- Stop!
...45, 46, 47...
- Hello.
- Hello.
There's nothing for you.
For you.
Lededeva?
- That's me.
- Palyukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest son on the Ukrainian front.
I didn't know Boris, but everyone says he was a gifted young man.
Was?
Missing doesn't mean dead.
Of course not.
That didn't come out right.
What's the matter, Veronica?
I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
My dear, what are you saying?
- I've lost everything.
- You have your life ahead of you.
I don't want to live!
What's the use?
- Forget the past.
It's human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
There's nothing I need to forget.
You mustn't punish yourself forever.
I must.
Till the end.
You teach history.
You're an intelligent woman.
Tell me:
What is the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Perhaps it's that...
Was Chernov here?
No.
Boy, am I hungry!
If Chernov comes, try to be polite.
He's revolting.
I may find him even more revolting than you do, but he's the boss.
Why do you always kiss up to him?
Dear Veronica, you're impossible.
You're always so irritable, and you keep picking on me.
Tell me what I can do for you.
I wish you had never been born.
Come in!
- I hope I'm not intruding.
- We're always happy to see you.
Make yourself comfortable.
Did you hear?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
It's awful.
But don't worry.
We'll show them yet.
Please, make yourself comfortable.
Your place is cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I live like a homeless tramp.
Hello, Veronica.
- Where are you going, dearest?
- I'm on duty at the hospital.
- Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's always so candid, so pure.
She must be very happy with you.
I looked for you today at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
- No.
Will you be at the birthday party tonight?
Probably.
- What will you take for a gift?
- What can I give?
Yes... the war.
It's nothing great, but attach a little something to it and I'm sure Antonina will be very happy.
It's wonderful.
How much do I owe you?
- It's nothing.
Don't mention it.
- Thanks very much.
Mark, I have a favor to ask.
Is there anyone upstairs?
No.
Do you think you could ask Fyodor Ivanovich for some medicine?
Good job, Irina.
He's going to live.
I hope so.
He'll be a real swine if he dies.
Irina, you should have been born a man!
I feel pretty good as a woman.
Veronica, why are you so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl.
I'll never forgive what she did to Boris.
Here comes another batch!
I've told you already, we're full!
This is a hospital, not a sardine can!
Where are they all from?
Kalach?
- Stalingrad.
Some from the front, some from the hospital.
There's no room.
Don't worry, they'll make room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Now, then... give my regards to Uncle Sergei,
Fyodor, Vassily,
Aunt Marya, Agrafena,
Katerina, Varvara,
Nikolai,
Katerina.
You already said Katerina.
This is a different Katerina.
- Then you should say so.
- It's okay.
They'll figure it out.
So...
Zinaida,
Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
What's the matter, Vorobyev?
Nothing.
I want the nurse.
He needs the bedpan.
I'll get it for you.
Thank you.
That's lovely music.
Turn up the radio, please.
Turn off that music!
Turn that music off!
You hear me?
Who yelled?
I did!
What's it to you?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Go away!
He's losing his mind.
He got word from home this morning.
His girlfriend didn't wait for him.
She married someone else, the bitch.
He hasn't eaten all day.
Try to comfort him.
Broads like that are worse than fascists.
They aim right at the heart.
You have to eat, Zakharov, or you won't get well.
I don't want to get well!
I want to die!
Call the doctor!
Calm down.
All because of some broad!
Call the doctor!
Quit yelling!
Shut up!
Where will they take us now?
There are plenty of hospitals in the world.
The head doctor's coming, boys!
Stop it this minute!
You're still a soldier in the Red Army!
Are you trying to get discharged?
Are you afraid we'll heal your hands and send you back to the front?
No, Doctor, he's not like that.
He got a letter.
- I know.
That's just an excuse.
Big deal!
So your bride ran off.
You should be glad!
She isn't worth a penny if she would trade a handsome guy like you, a real hero, for some rat sitting out the war at home!
It's she who's forfeited her happiness, not you!
And that's what she deserves.
That's right.
She's got a petty soul.
People like her can't understand how much suffering we've gone through.
Killing people like her would be too kind!
You stood up to Death itself.
You looked death in the face.
You approached it with your chest stuck out.
And she couldn't even pass the little test of time.
Women like her deserve only our contempt.
There can be no forgiveness for them!
Bandage him up.
Aunt Sima, bring him some tea and porridge.
Don't be a brat.
Veronica...
You idiot!
Keep an eye on your kid!
And it would have been my fault!
Just standing there with your mouth open like an idiot!
- Whose boy are you?
- Mama's.
- Where are you from?
- Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
What's your name?
Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert at the hospital.
- Can't you tell a better lie?
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- He is now.
- Here.
- Thank you, Anna.
A little boy is having a birthday and I wanted to give him a present.
You are a kind man after all, Mark Alexandrovich.
"The symptoms of such compound fractures depend on the degree of changes in the joints, as well as on the location."
Interesting, but unintelligible.
Why, I think it's quite clear.
What's this?
What kind of trick is this?
What trick?
He lost his parents at the station.
You should have taken him to the shelter for lost kids.
I don't want to go to the shelter!
Go there yourself!
- Rude child!
- You're rude.
Quiet, quiet.
We'll go find Mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Stop that noise!
It's hurting my ears.
Here, play with this cap!
Here's a bagel for you.
- My eardrums will burst!
- We need to find a toy for him.
Irina, take him for a minute.
So now I have to hold him too?
Here, give him to me.
Come to me, little one.
I'll get you ready for bed.
Has anyone seen my squirrel?
Mark took it.
Mark?
Where'd he take it?
To give to some little boy as a present.
Some little boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
Where did he go?
You know, don't you?
Where?
Probably to see Antonina.
What Antonina?
Ask Mark.
- Tell me.
- Don't give me orders.
Mark... visits her occasionally.
You understand?
- You're saying this to hurt me.
- Why would I?
Just to spite me!
I'm loved.
I have a husband.
And you're still an old maid.
She lives in a small house near that large market.
You can check it out for yourself.
It's okay, it's okay.
I have to do something, I have to do something.
Talk to Mark when he comes back.
You should wait.
Wait?
Always waiting.
I'm always waiting.
I've had enough!
What use are words
Let lips fall silent
Sometimes
They tell lies
The eyes alone
Will never dare
To lie to other eyes
My eyes are now
Dark and sad
As though someone
Had blown out their flame
In Leningrad on my birthday, we'd take a car and go from one end of the city to the other.
Let's go for a ride!
In these times, Antonina, a car is worth its weight in gold, and gasoline is rationed.
Any kind of vehicle.
I beg you!
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
Anything you like.
A ride against the forces of nature!
Just the two of us?
To forget everything else.
I'll try.
I love you.
Sorry.
I don't dance.
I thought I had tried everything, but I've never tried golden nuts.
Look, a message.
A birthday note for me?
So it's for your birthday?
Where's my squirrel?
Don't get the wrong idea.
There's a note from someone named Boris.
"My only love, happy birthday to you."
On this day you came into this world.
It's hard to leave you.
But what can we do?
This is war.
There's no way around it.
We can't continue living happily as we did before when death stalks our land.
But we'll be happy yet.
I love you.
I have faith in you.
Your Boris.
What are you so excited about?
Go home.
I'll be there soon.
What's that for?
Take your coat off.
Thank you.
You know, as usual all the Philharmonic's cars are taken, and I need one badly.
You're the head surgeon and all.
Surely you won't refuse...
We're very short on vehicles.
It was hard to do what I did for you, but I did it.
When you asked me to, I did my best.
What did I ask?
For an exemption.
It's about to expire, and this time, getting a new one will be practically impossible.
- What exemption?
- For Mark Alexandrovich.
Don't worry.
Not a soul will know about this.
Is it possible he lied to both of us?
He even offered me money in your name.
I'm sorry.
Very good.
Uncle Fyodor,
I turn to you for help.
Her behavior's impossible.
She stormed into a stranger's place, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you think anyone wants to send his son to war?
What are you talking about?
Or do you think others must pay for your welfare, for your life, with their hands, their legs, their eyes, their lives,
and you owe nothing to anyone?
I have an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
An exemption?
Tell me, how did you get it?
Why are you doing this?
It's okay.
I'll rent a room, I'll take Boris...
Perhaps someone else had better rent himself a room.
Gladly!
I've thought about doing that for a long time.
Why didn't you throw me out in the first place?
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only someone without a heart could reproach you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I don't want to hide behind someone else's back.
I won't!
Think it over.
Could you tell me where the Borozdins live?
They live here.
Which of them do you want to see?
- Fyodor Ivanovich.
He's not home.
Did Boris send you?
What Boris?
No, I came on my own.
I must speak to Fyodor Ivanovich.
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.
He'll be home soon.
- May I go for a walk?
- You may.
Is he yours?
He looks like you.
Are you a relation of the Borozdins?
Not exactly.
You see, I'm out of the army.
Going home?
It's unlikely.
There's still a blockade around Leningrad.
I'm in a difficult situation.
- What is it?
- It's easy to tell you.
You're not part of the family.
Fyodor Ivanovich's son was killed.
Where?
West of Smolensk.
What shall I play for you?
Whatever you like.
Did you see him buried?
No.
I was injured and they carried me away on a stretcher, but a friend of his, Stepan, went up to him.
Now I have to find his girlfriend.
He loved her very much.
That's me.
Vladimir, come to see us if you're ever in Moscow.
Thank you.
I'll do that.
The war's over.
Strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
Yes, I am.
One must always hope for the best.
Why do you delude yourself?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
How he was wounded?
How he fell?
But you didn't see him die with your own eyes.
No... but why haven't you heard from him?
A lot of things could have happened.
There's no word from Stepan either.
At the factory they know he's in some special unit and will be back soon.
Dasha promised to tell me when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
- Look, here they come!
- The victors are coming!
Boris!
- Veronica!
- Stepan!
Flowers for you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Here.
Dear mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers!
The happiness of our reunion is immeasurable.
The heart of every Soviet citizen is filled with joy.
Joy sings in our hearts.
It is victory that has brought us this joy.
We have all waited for this moment.
Everyone's dizzy with happiness.
But we shall not forget those left behind on the battlefield.
Time will pass.
Towns and villages will be rebuilt.
Our wounds will heal.
But our fierce hatred of war will never diminish!
We share the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today, and we will do everything to insure that sweethearts are never again parted by war, that mothers need never again fear for their children's lives,
that fathers need never again choke back hidden tears.
We have won, and we shall live not to destroy, but to build a new life!
Why are you just standing there?
Give your flowers to whomever they're for.
Thank you, sister.
My beautiful granddaughter!
Look, look!
Cranes are flying over Moscow!
THE END
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
MOSFILM
Wait, Squirrel!
Here, put it on.
Look!
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly!
Look!
You see...
You with your "cranes like ships".

Who is there?
Wait!
Well, all right.
Say when, then.
Thursday, on the embankment.
Come on, that's too long.
Squirrel!
You haven't told me when!
Squirrel, at what time?
What time on Thursday?
No, I can't make it.
I'll be working.
- All right.
- Don't be late.
Squirrel!
- She's gone crazy over him.
- And he's over her.
That's love, my dear.
A harmless mental disturbance.
Grandma, why aren't you asleep?
Because it's time to get up, Boris!
Stop chomping!
Running around all night...
Are you jealous?
You haven't torn it, have you?
Your jacket's all right.
Outrageous!
It's noon and he's still in bed.
The boy deserves a good rest on Sunday.
He works hard.
That work of his will result in a marriage.
That's when you'll be really jealous.
For Irina, her diploma comes first.
Look out, Uncle Fedya.
She'll be a full professor soon, while you're still only a MD.
If children don't surpass their parents, then the children are fools and the parents are no better.
Thanks, Mamma.
This is Radio Moscow broadcasting over all of the Soviet Union!
- What is it?
- What has happened?
Boris!
We're at war!
Do you hear?
We're at war!
Leave me alone!
Hi!
Boris is working day and night.
Are you waiting for him?
I'm not waiting for anyone.
Veronica!
In time of war, one should not get confused.
One should hold on to a normal life pace.
Take me.
I dream of dedicating to you my first symphony.
Will you come to the concert?
Suppose the Army calls you up?
The Army?
I doubt it.
Hardly.
Why "hardly"?
The most talented ones will be exempted.
- Are you the most talented one?
- Me?
Certainly.
Why are you following me around?
Aren't you ashamed?
I am.
I tried to keep away from you.
I know, Boris is my cousin.
But I can't help myself!
Wait!
- Wait!
- I'm going home alone.
Hey, slow down!
You just had an operation.
I'd better be in shape for that field-pack.
They're not wasting men like you in the Army.
There'll only be one exemption here, and one of us'll get it.
They'd better give it to you.
You've got knowledge, experience.
And you've got talent.
Save your sketches.
My wife's already got my bag packed.
Well, as they say, let's get our bayonets ready.
Hey, Stepan!
Guys, give me a hand...
Stepan!
Excuse me, Sachkov.
- Where's the summons?
- Not yet.
I can't wait.
- Are you off now?
- No, I've got those sketches...
- I see.
Take care.
- Okay.
- Hey!
- Yeah?
- Have you told her?
- No, it's too early...
- You're right.
See you tomorrow.
- Right.
- Let go.
- I won't.
- You're going to fall down.
- No, I won't.
- You'll rip up the blackout.
- It's a blanket.
I'm going to call the militia.
I'm sick of the blackout.
Give me the blanket.
- Let go.
You'll fall.
- No, I won't.
Come on, Squirrel, cut it out.
Let me hang this up.
You didn't come to the embankment today, but Mark did.
- He's very handsome.
- So what?
- Aren't you jealous?
- What?
- Aren't you jealous?
- I haven't got the time for it.
I won't have much time either when I go to the architecture college.
You'll never pass the entrance exams.
- I will!
- I doubt it.
Cranes like ships Sailing up in the sky,
White ones and grey ones, With long beaks, they fly.
- Do you like my song?
- Very profound.
Oh frogs, you keep on croaking, Why didn't you think of looking up?
You went on leaping, in mud soaking That's why you ended eaten up.
- All right, you won, hero.
- I won, I won!
I won.
All right.
- D'you think you'll be drafted?
- Sure.
- You won't volunteer?
- I might.
Why not?
No, you won't!
I won't let you.
You know you'll get an exemption.
That's why you talk so big.
- Why do you think so?
- Everyone smart will be exempted.
Then the only ones to do the fighting will be the fools.
I don't want to talk to you ever again.
Veronica, there's something I must tell you.
I don't want to hear it.
And, please, don't call me Veronica.
- Who am I?
- Squirrel.
Listen...
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- It's a secret.
If you give me something sweet, I'll eat it up and forget about it.
Give me something to remember you with.
Kiss me now.
When I'm with you, I'm not afraid of anything.
Not even the war.
Though, I'm afraid of the militia.
- Veronica...
- You know what?
- Do you know?
- No.
I'll have a beautiful white dress made for our wedding.
One like my grandmother had.
And a veil...
Very long and white.
And you should wear your dark suit.
- And you and I will go...
- To a registry office.
- Is it a deal?
- It's a deal.
- You know I like this blackout.
- What's so good about it?
Hi!
- Stepan!
- Veronica!
- I've got a treat for both of you.
- Fine.
- What is it?
- It's a secret.
- Has it arrived?
- Yes, this morning.
- Why didn't you say so?
Tell me.
- Well, go on.
You should've seen what's going on over at the factory.
Make it short, will you?
I'm telling you:
there's so much excitement...
- Never mind that.
- Your folks told me...
- When do we report?
- Today at 5:30.
Look at those cherries!
Is anything wrong?
- They're nice!
- Army orders.
- No!
For you?
- Me too.
We both volunteered...
When?
- You volunteered?
- It's army orders.
Wait!
What about us?
Stepan...
No, I've got to go.
My folks are going to...
So long.
Squirrel!
I didn't want to tell you before your birthday.
- And now I have to go.
- Of course.
Boris!
Squirrel, what is this?
White cranes flying...
I like that.
I'm going to be all right.
Do you hear?
And after that we'll live together...
a hundred years.
Go on now.
We'll say goodbye later.
Don't be late.
What difference would it make if he went a day later?
What a nerve if he's still with Veronica.
- Boris!
- Did Dad call?
He was furious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
So that we didn't have any scenes like that.
Get these prints back to the factory tomorrow.
- Give them to Kuzmin, the engineer.
- I will, don't worry.
What are you putting in there?
I'm going out for a bottle of wine.
Grandma, do me a favor.
Just a minute...
- Will they send you to the front?
- Probably.
Here, Grandma...
Wait.
Tomorrow when you get up, take this to her...
- What is it?
- Her birthday present.
And help her.
After all, it's war...
Please, be kind to her.
And what if I die?
You don't have the right, especially now, with so many secrets to protect.
- Well, suppose I do...
- Come on...
Quiet now, Grandma.
That's Veronica!
No, it's just Irina.
Thank heaven, you've come.
- Boris!
- Yes?
Come over here.
You're 25 years old and you behave like a fool.
What are we, children?
What is it?
Are we playing hide and seek?
Are you starved for adventures?
What kind of a man are you?
Where's Irina, and Mark?
Irina is making coffee, Mark went out for wine.
Coffee, wine...
What kind of send-off is that?
Irina!
Bring that thing from the medicine chest.
Boris, come over here.
- Where is Veronica?
- She'll be here.
- But where's she?
- She's busy.
She's supposed to be here.
Her fiance is going away.
I'm not her fiance.
- What are you then?
- Just a friend...
- That sounds suspicious...
- I don't mean that way, Dad.
- Then what do you mean?
- Look, give me a break.
- Here's the alcohol.
- Have it diluted.
I got some port wine.
Drink it yourself.
We'll have a more robust drink.
Well, are we all here?
Let's sit down.
It's Veronica.
Aren't you going to welcome her, friend?
At last!
Is Boris home?
We're from the factory.
Please, come in.
I thought it was the fiancee.
- We've come from the factory.
- What about the presents?
- Sorry.
This one's yours.
- Yes...
Thank you.
On behalf of the Factory Committee...
Comrade Boris, you must fight to the last drop of your blood.
Smash the accursed fascists, and we, in the factory, will fulfil and overfulfil our quotas.
We've heard all that before.
You'd better join us and drink to my son, Boris.
Well, I suppose... life in this world of ours is not yet what we would like it to be.
Now you're going to war, Boris...
- Let's drink.
- To you.
Irina!
What about Grandma?
We saw my brother off last night.
My mother was crying...
- What about you?
- I was too.
- On whose behalf, the committee's?
- I wasn't thinking about that.
There's no one to see off in our family, we have 3 girls and Mom.
It's somewhat embarrassing...
I feel left out...
Yes, and when they come back, you'll really envy us.
The trouble is, not all of them will be coming back.
For those who don't, a magnificent monument, with their names inscribed in gold.
Irina, don't just sit there.
Fill the glasses.
And you folks in the rear, fulfil and overfulfil!
Now, Grandma, don't forget.
Mark, stay with Dad.
He'll be all right.
I'll see you off.
About face!
Platoon, forward march!
Take it, Grandma!
- Boris!
- Mamma!
- I won't see him again.
- I'm sorry, Mamma.
Drink it.
You'll feel better.
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.
But you aren't on call now.
Varvara Kapitonovna, I've got to see Boris...
He's gone.
- Gone?
Where?
- To report for the Army.
- Oh, no!
- Come in.
- Where was he supposed to report?
- I don't know.
What is it?
It's from Boris.
For your birthday.
There's a note inside.
- Where's the note?
- Why?
Isn't it there?
Maybe it fell?
Maybe he forgot in a hurry.
- Forgot?
- He'll write to you.
Where were you?
- Where's Boris gone?
- It's the schoolyard near the park.
Calm down, she'll be here.
It would be quite a job finding someone in this crowd.
What are you doing?
Write to me.
Write every day.
Didn't I tell you to ship the cauliflower?
An airplane is high above, Over the roofs it's droning.
It's my sweetheart sends his love From his sky-high soaring.
It was used to be before That he saw me to my door.
Now it's been quite a turn-off:
I'm the one to see him off!
Don't forget to write your Army Post Office number.
- Cheer up, pug-nose!
- We'll wait till you come back.
Goodbye, Boris!
Take care!
Fall in!
She will come.
Boris!
Boris!
Dress!
Attention!
Forward march!
Boris!
That's my little chicken!
Boris!
Boris!
Grandma...
Nothing?
He hasn't written to me either.
- Any news?
- No.
Oh, this damn war!
We'll have to keep going somehow.
Have you decided about a job?
I'm starting at the war factory tomorrow.
Air-raid alert!
Hurry on to the subway.
I've got to finish this.
Get your things.
- Where's the knapsack?
- It's over there.
I won't go without you.
If it gets bad, we'll run down.
Go on, now.
Be careful in the subway!
She's so frightened, poor thing.
Aren't you?
When I know that Veronica's safe and you're with me,
I'm not such a coward.
The filthy murderers!
We'll get back at you, you wait!
He's not writing to me.
Oh, he must have written.
It's just the mail.
All clear!
The air raid has been terminated.
Let's go!
Here's where I live now.
If you decide to work with us, call me at the factory.
- I will.
- Goodbye.
Get down here!
Come back!
What's the matter?
Are you crazy?
I'm sorry.
Veronica, you can stay with us from now on.
You can have Boris' room.
Mark will move in with Fedya...
Mark, she'll need some attention to keep her from brooding.
Irina and I are so busy at the hospital.
I'll do what I can, Uncle Fedya.
I promised Boris.
- Is it agreed?
- Um-hmm.
Is this the factory?
May I speak to Kuzmin?
He was drafted, too?
Excuse me, has anyone heard from Boris Borozdin?
If it weren't for this damn war,
I'd be playing this in the Tchaikovsky Hall.
For you.
Veronica!
Let's go to the subway.
- I'm not going.
- Don't be silly.
Come on.
- Are you afraid?
- For you.
Come with me.
I'm not afraid of anything.
- Veronica, let's go to the subway!
- No, I'm not going.
- Stop it!
You've gone crazy!
- I'm not going!
I love you.
No.
- I love you!
- No!
No!
- I love you!
- Go away!
- I love you!
- No!
No!
No!
It's stupid to get surrounded like this.
- Stepan, quit whining.
- Who's whining?
I'm not.
The captain said we might be able to break out by tonight.
Yeah, that's what he says.
Sachkov!
Where'd you find that rookie?
In the incubator.
He's our reinforcements.
Now we'll break through for sure.
Is that a way to talk about a married soldier?
I got yoked in my last year of school.
The result of too much of education.
You're funny.
Laughed yourselves right into a trap, I guess.
- Volodya, you really married?
- I said it to sound important.
- Borozdin!
- Yes?
You'll go on a reconnaissance mission.
You got to find the best place for us to break through tonight.
- Turn in your documents.
- Yes, sir.
Hey, Sachkov!
Take this, will you?
Why don't we rest?
And have a smoke.
Is she always laughing like that?
She probably thinks we're all dead.
Let me see that beauty.
Hey, that's the soldier's life for you!
- You're here, and she...
- And she what?
Hey, let me try that thing.
- Hold it, will you, Sachkov?
- Certainly.
Not bad for a first try.
Stop that!
- Aren't you ashamed?
- No, sir.
- Five days under arrest!
- Yes, sir.
- You both go on a reconnaissance.
- Why?
Turn in your papers!
Boris, here.
On account of her?
- I'd say she was worth it.
- She sure is!
However, we must maintain discipline!
You hear that?
Discipline...
Stepan, keep this.
Be careful, don't lose it.
We...
We'll get married, Uncle Fedya.
Oh, I forgot.
There's some sausage left.
- Keep your head down!
- Stop ordering around!
Let's get out of here before they get wise.
- If you're scared, run.
- Come on, you idiot!
Hey!
Musician!
Are you deaf?
Why the devil I'v got tied up with him?
What's wrong with you?
Can you hear me?
- Go on.
I want to rest for a while.
- Are you wounded?
Hold on to me.
- Leave me alone.
- I tell you, get up!
Now hang on, hold tight.
This way's no good.
I'll have to carry you.
Come on, leave me here.
Are you still sore because I punched you?
- You were just lucky, otherwise...
- Shut up, we'll talk later.
Here we go...
Are you all right?
Hold on, friend.
It's only a little way to the woods.
We'll be safe there.
I'm winded.
Let's rest a bit.
It's a little quieter here.
How are you?
It's hard to breathe.
Hold on, we'll have to get you married yet...
Hey, buddy!
What's the matter with you?
What's wrong?
Forgive me, friend, forgive me...
It's my fault...
Forgive me...
friend...
Hey, somebody!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Can you hear me, Boris?
Are you hit?
It's nothing, I am just...
The Soviet Information Bureau reports that there were no important changes on the front in the past 24 hours.
No news is good news.
Families evacuated with Plant 326 will be quartered on Vosstaniya Street.
Comrades, report here, please.
- Irina, help me with the wounded.
- I'll get an orderly.
Everybody off!
Siberia!
We can't run much farther.
Poor Mother Russia!
Attention, please!
Chief of Army Hospital, Comrade Borozdin, please report to the military commandant at once.
Maybe we'll find peace here at last.
Out of the way, the evacuated.
Your stove is smoking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Save your dreaming till the war is over.
Where are you going?
To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
She wanders around like a ghost, all nerves.
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
From whom?
Her husband's not up at the front like ours.
She's not waiting for any letter.
- D'you have the 2nd shift at school?
- Yes.
Cranes like ships, Sailing up in the sky...
I can't get those silly verses out of my head.
There she is!
- Who?
- The mail carrier.
If I can count up to 50, there'll be a letter for me.
- One, two, three, four...
- Stop it, Veronica.
- Fifteen, sixteen...
- Veronica, this is madness.
- Nineteen, twenty...
- Stop it!
Forty-seven, forty-eight...
- Good morning!
- Good morning!
Sorry, nothing for you.
Here you are.
- Lebedeva?
- That's me.
- Paliukaitis?
- Nothing.
From my eldest.
From the Ukrainian Front.
I didn't know Boris.
But everyone says what a fine, talented boy he was.
Was?
Listed as missing in action doesn't mean he was killed.
Of course not.
I just didn't put it right.
- What's wrong, Veronica?
- I'm dying, Anna Mikhailovna.
Come on, Veronica.
You poor child.
I've lost everything.
You have your whole life before you.
I don't want it!
What's it good for?
You must forget the past.
It is human nature to forget.
I don't want to forget.
I don't need it.
But you can't go on tormenting yourself for your mistakes.
I should do it.
All my life.
You teach history.
You're a wise woman.
Tell me what's the meaning of life?
The meaning of life?
Maybe it's in...
- Did Chernov get here yet?
- Not yet.
Wow, I'm really famished!
Try to be nice to Chernov when he comes, please.
He makes me ill.
I feel exactly the same way, but after all he's my boss.
That gives you a reason to lick his boots?
Please, Veronica, this can't go on.
You're always so irritable, always criticizing.
Tell me, how can I make you happy?
Just disappear.
Come in, it's open.
Come in!
Mark, pardon my invasion.
Not at all.
It's a pleasure.
Here, let me take that.
Did you see the paper?
The Germans have advanced in the Caucasus.
Yes, it's awful.
But we'll show them what we're made of yet!
Please make yourself comfortable.
It's warm here.
Your place is nice and cozy.
My wife and children are in Tashkent, so I'm kind of homeless.
- Good day, Veronica.
- Good day.
- Where are you going, darling?
- To the hospital.
I'm on duty.
Bundle up.
It's very cold.
I admire your wife.
She's so honest...
She must be very happy with you.
- I was looking for you at the Philharmonic.
- Was there a concert?
No.
But are you going to the birthday party tonight?
I might.
- What are you giving her?
- What can I give her?
The war!
Yes, this war.
It's nothing gorgeous, of course, but tie a little trifle to it and Antonina will be pleased.
It's wonderful!
What do I owe you?
- It's really nothing, forget it.
- Thank you very much.
Mark, can you do me a favor?
- Is someone up there?
- No.
Could you get some drugs for me from Feodor Ivanovich?
Fine job, Irina.
He'll pull through.
I hope so.
It would be downright mean of him not to.
Irina, you should have been a man!
I'm doing all right as a girl.
Veronica!
What are you doing here so early?
The clock was fast.
Poor girl...
I can't forgive her for what she did to Boris.
New patients again!
I told them I have no more room.
I'm running a hospital, not a barrel of herrings!
- Are these from Kalach?
- From Stalingrad.
Some from the front line, others from the hospitals.
No place for us here, either.
Don't worry, they'll find room.
I'll take 80 men.
The rest will have to go to other hospitals.
Let's see now...
Please give my regards to Sergei,
Feodor, Vassily, Aunt Maria,
Agraphyona, Catherine, Barbara,
Nikolai, Catherine...
- You already said Catherine.
- That's another one.
- Don't you want to explain it?
- They'll figure it out.
So, Zinaida, Antonina, Kuzma...
Nurse!
- What do you want, Vorobyov?
- Never mind.
Nurse!
- He wants a potty.
- I'll give it to him.
Thanks.
That's beautiful music!
Turn it up a little louder, will you please?
Shut up your music!
Turn it down!
You hear me?
Who was that shouting?
I did, so what?
- Zakharov, what's wrong?
- Leave ma alone!
He's gone berserk.
He got bad news from home this morning.
His girl just got married to a friend of his, bitch.
He hasn't had a bite to eat.
Try to see what you can do, nurse.
Those broads are worse than fascists, aiming right in the heart.
You must try to eat.
It's the only way to get well.
I don't want to get well!
I just want to croak!
Get the doctor.
Calm down.
Please, calm down.
Because of a woman...
What a dumbbell!
Get the doctor!
Get the doctor now!
Quit that yelling!
Cackling like a bunch of hens!
Where will they take us now?
There're plenty of hospitals in this wide world.
Guys, the chief is coming!
Bastards!
Quiet down!
You're a soldier in the Red Army!
Want to desert it?
You afraid that if we cure you, you might go back in the army?
You're not being fair.
He got a bad letter from home.
I know.
That's just an excuse.
So what if his girl's left him?
Good riddance!
She's not worth a dime if she gave up a handsome soldier like this, a real hero, for a puny draft-dodger!
Right.
She's the one who's missed her happiness!
And whatever she's got, she deserves it!
What a petty soul!
Can a woman like that understand the suffering you've gone through?
Killing her would be too good for her kind.
You stood the most difficult trial.
You looked death in the face, went to meet it yourself.
And she couldn't stand the small test of time.
For women like that, no honorable man can have anything but contempt!
For such creatures there is no pardon!
Bandage him!
Aunt Sima, bring him fresh porridge and some hot tea.
Be good now.
Veronica...
What the hell kind of a mother are you?
Keep an eye on your kid!
And I'll be held responsible!
Daydreaming, you fool!
- Who are you?
- Mamma's boy.
- Where are you from?
- From Voroshilovgrad.
- How old are you?
- Three months and three years.
- What's your name?
- Boris.
- What?
- Boris.
- Why the fancy get-up?
- A concert in the hospital.
- A likely story!
- All right, all right.
- Is Mark here?
- So far yes.
I've been saving this for you.
Thank you very much, Anna Mikhailovna.
It's for a little boy we know.
It's his birthday.
I wish everyone were as kind- hearted as you are, Mark.
The symptomatology of this type of compound injury depends primarily on changes in the nodal structure...
- Interesting, but beyond me.
- Why, it's really quite simple.
They are not readily apparent to the clinical practitioner, but in most cases the etiology...
- What is this?
- What kind of a trick is that?
What do you mean, trick?
The poor child lost his parents.
I want my mommy!
You ought to have taken him to the Foundling Center.
You go yourself to the Center!
- Rude child!
- I'm not, you're rude!
Now, don't cry.
We'll go find your mommy in Voroshilovgrad.
Now, now, be quiet.
- Poor baby, he wants his mommy.
- Look, here comes a goat...
Stop rattling.
You're hurting my ears.
Here, play with the cover.
Don't you want it?
Oh, my God.
Here's a bagel roll for you.
Keep him quiet!
He's driving me crazy.
If we had some toys for him to play with...
Irina, take him for a minute.
Hah, what next?
Stop crying, will you?
Let me take him.
Come on, my little one, my little Boris...
I'll undress you and put you to bed...
Have anyone seen my squirrel?
Yes, Mark took it.
- Why?
- He's giving it to some boy.
My squirrel to a boy?
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
- Where's Mark?
- I don't know.
You're hiding something from me.
You know where he's, don't you?
Where's he?
He's probably gone to Antonina's party.
- What Antonina?
- Why don't you ask Mark?
- Who's she, tell me!
- Don't order me around.
Mark visits her occasionally.
Do you get it?
- You're saying this to spite me.
- Why would I want to?
Because I'm married, I'm loved, and you're still a spinster!
Stop it, Veronica!
Antonina lives near the food shop, in the little house next door.
Go over there and see for yourself.
Calm down.
I should do something.
When Mark comes home, you'll have a talk.
But now you must wait.
Sure, I must wait...
That's all I've been doing all the time.
That's enough!
May our lips benumb.
Words are futile.
They so often lie perchance.
And only our eyes Will never dare lie,
Forever true their parting glance.
My eyes are now sad and dark,
As though therein a candle was put out...
In Leningrad after my parties we'd go for a ride, from one part of the city to the other.
Arrange for a ride now.
There's a war on, Antonina.
Cars are worth its weight in gold, the gasoline is strictly rationed.
Get any kind of car!
I beg you!
A fire-engine, an ambulance, a truck... anything!
Let me hope where there's hope no longer!
Just the two of us?
To the point of full abandon?
I'll see what I can do.
I love you!
Sorry, I don't dance.
I thought I'd tried everything, but I've never tried golden chestnuts.
Look, a note!
- It's a birthday note for me.
- Congratulations!
Where's the squirrel?
Where's my squirrel?
Look, you mustn't think that...
There's a note here from somebody named Boris.
My only one, happy birthday...
On this day you were born.
It's hard leaving you.
But it can't be helped.
It's war!
I must go.
We can't go on living the way we did, enjoying ourselves while death stalks our land.
We will be happy some day.
I love you, I trust you.
Your Boris.
Why are you so alarmed?
Go home.
I'll be right back.
Why?
- Take your coat off.
- Thank you.
You know, all the Philharmonic cars are being used tonight, and I must have a car.
You're Chief Surgeon, you won't refuse me this little favor...
Transportation is our most critical problem.
It was difficult for me too, but I did my best.
I went out of my way, because you asked me...
- What I asked you?
- The exemption.
Now it's about to expire, and this time to get it will be almost impossible.
- What d'you mean, exemption?
- The exemption for Mark.
You can be sure I handled the whole thing discreetly.
Could Mark have done it without informing you?
He even offered me money in your name...
I'm sorry.
I'm glad you're here, Uncle Fedya.
I wish you'd talk to her.
She burst in without being invited, started a fight...
Shut the door.
Do you believe that anybody likes having his son marching off to war?
What do you mean?
Or do you believe that for your petty pleasures and well-being others must lose their arms, legs, eyes, jaws, even their lives?
And you owe nothing to no one?
You know I've got an exemption, Uncle Fedya.
Tell us how you got this exemption.
What are you doing, Veronica?
It's all right.
I'm going to rent a room.
And I'm taking the boy...
Perhaps someone else had better rent a room?
Gladly.
I've been wanting to for a long time.
I wish you'd driven me out in the first place.
You've been through a terrible ordeal.
Only one who had done something worse could have condemned you.
Stay with us.
I can't.
I cannot hide behind someone else's back.
I don't want to.
Think it over.
Listen, where can I find the Borozdin family?
- Which one are you looking for?
- Feodor Ivanovich.
He is not in at the moment.
Are you from Boris?
No, I'm by myself.
I have to see Feodor Ivanovich.
- Won't you sit down?
- Thanks.
Feodor Ivanovich should be here in a few minutes.
- May I go out?
- All right.
- Is he yours?
- Yes, he's mine.
He looks like you.
Are you a relative of the Borozdins?
Not really.
Well, I've done all the fighting I'll ever do.
Going home?
Not yet.
Leningrad's still blockaded.
- Yeah, I'm in a spot.
- Why?
I guess there's no harm in telling you because you're not the family.
But how do you tell a man his son was killed?
- Where did it happen?
- Near Smolensk.
What do you want me to play?
I don't care.
Tell me, did you see him buried?
No.
I was put on a stretcher and taken to a hospital, and he was with a friend of his, Stepan.
Stepan...
I've got to find his girl now.
He was really in love with her.
I'm the girl.
Come to see us when you're in Moscow, Volodya.
Thanks very much.
I will.
The war's over.
It's strange, isn't it?
And you're still waiting?
I am.
One must always keep on hoping.
What's the use of waiting?
I saw it with my own eyes.
What did you see?
You saw him wounded?
You saw him fall?
You didn't see him die.
But if he's alive, why hasn't he written to you?
Anything could happen.
Stepan hasn't written to anyone either.
They know at the factory that he was in some Special Operations.
Dasha promised to let me know when he's back.
Boris is alive.
He's alive.
Look!
The victors are coming!
Kolia, darling, you're back!
Boris!
Veronica!
Stepan!
The flowers...
For you.
Well?
What?
You see...
Well...
My darling!
Dear mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters!
The happiness of our reunion is boundless.
The heart of every Soviet citizen sings with joy, the joy of victory!
We have all waited for this happy moment.
We dreamed of it in the darkest hours of our struggle.
But we'll never forget those who lie silent on the battlefield.
Years will pass, our cities will rise again, and our wounds may one day be forgotten.
Let one thing remain in our hearts, a cold hatred of war!
We deeply feel the grief of those who cannot meet their loved ones today.
We must all take a vow to keep our promise that sweethearts will never again be parted by war, that mothers may never again fear for their children, that our brave fathers may not stealthily swallow their tears.
We have won and remained alive, not for destruction but to build a new life!
Don't just stand there.
Give the flowers to whoever they're for.
Thank you very much, sister.
Oh, what a darling!
What a chubby little darling!
Look, the cranes are flying over Moscow!
The End
Oh, mighty God
Please take my soul, to ask You why You torture me
Take my soul or alleviate the suffering
Oh, God, are You...
I ask Your forgiveness
I know You exist, my heart shivers hearing Your name
But I wonder, and You are the Most Merciful and Righteous
Why are we led to temptation?
Why does sin take over virtue?
Why does the evil in our souls overcome the goodness?
Why does one sin then remorse and ask for forgiveness?
I have committed many sins but I am confused;
was it my deprivation from my mother that pushed me towards evil?
My parents were divorced when I was two
And my father was responsible for bringing me up
He was my father, brother and mother as well
He granted me his youth, he lived only to please me
Nevertheless, nothing compensated for the loss of my mother
I envied any girl that had a mother
In a girl's life, there are things only a mother understands
These things were like a barrier between me and my dad when I started to turn into a young woman
It made me feel lonely and deprived
My father was the only thing I really possessed
I didn't demand for my rights as a daughter only, but more
I considered myself responsible for his happiness
We lived with my uncle who was only a few years older than I was
I was the lady of the house
My face had no sinister look to it
It is an innocent face, like that of a child who hadn't yet peen polluted by life's ugliness
I started my evil deeds by pulling small pranks that later developed into big disasters
Even my schoolmates were not exempted from them
Kawthar was in love with my cousin, Medhat
I convinced her falsely that Medhat loves me
I was able to part between them and ruin their lives just because I liked being evil but I would cry also
I cried for long nights, in regret for what I had done
And I was forever sleepless
SLEEPLESS
Based on a novel by:
Ehsan Apdel Koddous
Directed by:
Salah Apu Seif
Then came the day when I felt my life was really falling apart
I was sixteen, attending boarding school
My father came and took permission from the principal to take me home
You know something, Nadia
I don't like your staying in a boarding school
Why?
It's a great school
You know I sent you there because I had to
After you've grown like this, you couldn't stay home without a woman to look after you
Nanny Halima is like a mother to me
Well, at the end of the day, she's still a nanny
I have worried about you all my life
There were so many little issues in your life that I couldn't approach you with
Only a woman could talk to you about those issues
I never complained
Yes, but we have to live together forever
You know, when you get married,
I will make sure that your husband will take us both
We can never live together though unless I married
- Married?
- Yes, Nadia
I have lived without marriage for 14 years, for your sake
And now I married for your sake too
The only condition in the woman I was going to marry was that she would take care of you, and I found her
- I am sure you'll love her
- You should love her
If you love her, Nadia, I will love her
- Congratulations
- Just a plain congratulation?
I only want you to be happy, Daddy
Hello, Nadia
You're more beautiful than your picture
Aunt Safiya
Planning to get drunk, Aziz?
This is your third drink
What to do?
I'm starving
Looks like Nadia won't appear unless I go get her
How posh!
Bless your hands, Safy
See the difference a lady's presence makes in a house!
What have you done to yourself?
What is this hairstyle?
- Is it ugly?
- No, not at all
You look just like Aunt Safiya now
I am not as cute as Nadia
Nadia is beautiful, have a seat
Sit over there, Nadia, in the seat across me
Come on, darling
It's our fate to take the back seat
Well, get yourself a bride
- Here's my bride!
- I'd never give her to you!
You are always at night clubs!
When I was young, I wanted to marry Daddy
Well, he's taken now, I am the only one left
No man in this whole world is worthy of Nadia
Not even Daddy?
Your father is one of a kind
But I hope you find a man like him
- What's for vegetables?
- Messakaa
Oh, God!
It doesn't go well with whiskey
I have a long night yet, tonight is the big night
Do you hear that?
All his nights are like that
Actually, I asked the cook to make Messakaa because I learned that Nadia likes it
Tell me your favorite meals and I'll make them for you
- I like late nights
- And borrowing money
Oh, now you are reminding me of the 100 pounds I owe you!
- I'm not eating then!
- Why, Aziz?
Let him go, he probably has a date;
he's been looking at his watch
You are not a niece, you are a wicked mother-in-law!
- Good bye
- Good bye
Stop drinking, would you?
Good night
Will you sleep this early?
Yes, I'm a bit tired
Good night, darling
Don't forget to close the balcony door
- Good night, Auntie
- Good night, Nadia
- It's getting cold
- I don't think so
It's going to turn on fire
As long as you are by my side, I feel on fire
- What are you doing?
- Getting warm
This is not how to do it..
Hasn't Nadia woken up yet?
Not yet, sir
Put this vase on the cupboard over there
Halima, wake Nadia up, it's ten o' clock
- Good morning, Nadia
- Good morning
I hope you get married soon
Your father, Lady Safiya and your uncle are waiting for you
- Uncle is awake?
- Yes
Everything has changed since Lady Safiya came
I feel that everything in the house is newer and prettier
The furniture is still the same, it was just too close together
I never thought I would ever wake up this early
Early?
It's 10:30!
Tomorrow, breakfast is at 8:00, we'll force you out of bed
Your father's marriage is trouble for me and you
- Good morning
- Good morning, dear
We should take Nadia to the doctor
I think she's a bit pale, she needs some vitamins
Vitamins?
No, all she needs is a husband
Husband?
Who could we fool into marrying her?
Remember when I asked you to make me scrambled eggs
You burned your hand, and nearly burned the house down!
We all did that as kids
I will teach her everything, she'll be just like me
I wish she'd be only half of you
Why do you want to marry me off?
Bored of me?
Safiya?
No one is answering
You answer it
Hello, how are you, Auntie?
Thursday?
What time?
Seven?
Definitely, yes, we'll be there
Bye-bye, Auntie
You know what, Daddy?
I'll never speak to my friend Aliya again
Why?
She's a nice, funny friend
I was once at her place, she left me alone and talked to her boyfriend on the phone
She was talking to him while her mother was sitting next to us
Be fair!
She was talking to him, pretending he was a girl
The strange thing is her tongue didn't slip once
- Live and let live
- Believe her, Ahmed, girls these days can do anything
Who wants to come to the club for some fun?
I'd love to but I have things to do
- Take Nadia with you
- I am tired
- We'll expect you for lunch
- I've forgotten what junk food is like!
Let's go
I am very sorry, miss
I apologies again, a hundred times
- Okay
- Okay what?
- Accept my apology
- What if I don't?
I won't eat or sleep
- It's over
- Thanks, see you around
- Anyone bugging you?
- Not at all
I know Mostafa, he thinks he's still a youngster
I don't like young men anyway
He's a playboy, everyday a new girlfriend
And you are straight?
Where were you just now?
Playing backgammon
So, was your opponent a brunette or a blonde?
Watch it, Ahmed
- Yes?
- Is this Mr. Mostafa?
Yes, who is this?
I am a girl, don't you like talking to women?
I am sure you would enjoy talking to me
No one prodded me to call you, no
I happen to like you
So you've seen me, you know me
It's not fair, you have the advantage!
This is selfishness!
You can imagine me as we speak
But I will always be asking myself: who is she?
Is she pretty or ugly?
Who told her to call me?
Be patient, you won't regret it
Later, when I feel comfortable about you
Who told you I needed more women?
Did I beg you to call me and test me - to see if I am worthy of you or not?
Wait a minute
- Wait a second
- I'll hang up
First you didn't want to talk, now you can't wait for a second?
This phone thing is old-fashioned
Times have changed
There are now clubs and social gatherings for people to meet and know each other
It's not logical for a girl to reveal half her body at the beach and then hide her identity on the phone
People have no time for such hypocrisy
Did you expect me to jump at you and say I loved you?
Since we've gone this far, please tell me your name
I will count till three
If you don't tell me I'll hang up 1, 2, 3
- Wrong number
- My name is Nadia Lotfy
My father is Ahmed Lotfy, we live in Dokki
You saw me and you liked me
You even threw your ball at me this morning
Great!
When will we meet?
Please, Nadia
Since we will meet anyway, then the sooner, the better
Tomorrow at 4:30 in front of the Horse-Riding Club
No, 4:30
I am confused, almost lost
As if an invisible hand pushed me towards an unknown fate
I needed someone by my side
I needed someone to guide me to the path of security
But I had no one
I couldn't ask my father's opinion, nor his wife's
I felt just as lonely as I had before
I feel afraid of Mostafa
He is stronger and older than I am, and more experienced
Should I turn back?
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes experienced.
