I went to jail and got beaten with a vacuum for her.
Anyway, friends come here late at night?
Oh, I forgot something!
Think it's too coincidental?
Gyeon-woo:
What?
And don't...
The worst of his kind.

He's conscious, but in critical condition

Visevac, village in Sumadija (part of Serbia)
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes.
Let's get back to the plane.
Come in.
I think you ought to know I'm working for the railroad again.
- Tonight I was carrying the payroll.
- That'll be six bits.
Them miners can eat more beans than they raise in all of Boston.
Any of you boys win enough to buy a drink?
- When'd you get here?
Is she?
Do you remember Whitey Harbin?
It's lucky your father and the one boy were out visiting.
How long were you in the mountains?
That you gave it before witnesses, gave it to women and children.
Or your family.
Yes, but will Joe Matson wait?
Associate Director
Irina!
I'm going to rent a room.
- Don't you want to explain it?
We'll dance at your wedding yet.
A fire engine, an ambulance, a truck.
- What will you give me tomorrow?
- When do we report?
The poor thing is waiting for a letter.
What are you doing, Veronica?
- I am tired
I can walk right alongside of you night and day, Cameron.
Open the door.
Get away from him.
With one of those, he could circulate freely.
She won't be able to have lunch with you today, she's lunching with me.
There are too many Japanese patrols.
This is ours.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
English corned beef.
- That's all there is to it.
We've known about your actual rank for nearly a week.
Do you think he'll be all right?
The meeting is closed.
We must draw up our plans then arrange a conference with Saito and set him straight.
He'll finish his lecture any moment now.
I think he has too much imagination as distinct from cold calculation.
-Fine.
If your sea rescue plane hadn't spotted me, I wouldn't be here.
I kind of got used to being a commander so when I arrived at the hospital I took a look at the enlisted men's ward and then the officer's ward and I said to myself, " Let's let it ride along for a while."
What are you doing?
A SIMULATED MAJOR.
ONE WILL STAY HERE WITH ME.
Thank you.
Escape is impossible.
-Yes, sir.
Jolly good show, major!
-Good.
I wonder if fresh air and light duties might do more than being cooped up.
- Never mind.
Now.
That is, I didn't have my charter.
-Yes, Jennings?
So long as they have that idea, they'll be soldiers and not slaves.
Always use your knife immediately, Joyce.
Goodbye, Mrs. Brenner.
Poor John Hamilton.
- Hurry up, it's heavy.
You always faint when there's some sort of trouble.
Where are we going?
Yes, sir?
All right.
Where am I calling from?
BURGER:
I will now call Dr. Frank Renault.
Your slippers are in here waiting for you.
Well, of course someone was there.
Everybody knows we can't control the workings of our minds, don't they?
You help yourself.
New neighbours?
Old man is dead.
I had to.
But he won't make you happy either.
He saw right through you.
Goddamn it!
Stop blocking the runway.
You try that again!
That's news to these ears.
Just my luck, there was a cleaver handy.
In any case, this is real trouble.
And that he could put in a good word for me if I made it worth his while.
But that's all, I swear.
Do you know any reason why Christine Helm should give the evidence she has
- What an awful woman.
Because she was rich, and you were after her money.
In your experience, Inspector, when burglars or burglaresses break into a house, do they leave without taking anything?
That woman was one old inoffensive crazy person and he does accomplice to me of murder!
It's not a crime, is it?
Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough to identify your letter paper.
My doctors would never allow it.
It's tragic.
- Congratulations.
- But Christine must give evidence.
Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.
I did?
♪ I may never go home any more ♪
Want to kiss me, ducky?
- I hope it still fits.
- Not yet.
As your counsel will tell you, Vole, you will very shortly have an opportunity of speaking in your own defence.
Just yes or no, please.
Why?
The other pill.
Might as well get a bigger box, more mothballs, put me away too.
That woman, she was a harmless old fool, and he makes of me an accomplice to the murder.
- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.
First to determine if the stains were human blood, then to classify it by group or type.
My objection then was overruled by Mr. Justice Swindon.
Might as well get a bigger box, more mothballs, put me away too.
Come on, I'll give you five minutes.
- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.
A match!
You will certainly be charged with perjury,
You can't, not after what I've done.
No motive whatsoever.
It was gratitude, then, that prompted you to give him an alibi
You don't get arrested or convicted for crimes you haven't done.
How true is the saying that a duck won't drown, for a spit awaits it.
Not a step back!
Her daddy won't even know her.
He has my parrot.
And how do you say, "I am going for a walk by the sea today"?
Iphigenie?
Well, it was.
We can alternate.
- No, no.
How do you know that?
-you will never see your nephew again.
The odds are too great even for Zorro.
Uh, Diego, you remember my daughter MagdaIena?
well, have you forgotten that Ricardo is also my friend?
Every time I turn around, he stops me.
The governor has given his word that if Joaquin Castenada will ride into Monterey carrying a flag of truce no one will harm him.

Why should we share all this beautiful gold with anyone?
Then you will, of course, defend your honor.

Captain, when does this war go to end?
I don't care if it does!
- I don't want to be with anybody else.
- No, wait.
That's a good boy.
- Oh, thank you.
They assigned me to the auto ambulance.
- [Chuckles]
The X-ray.
- And two girls.
That is not an ankle.
- Become more powerful from it.
Do you like to keep scorpions?
Recently our planes were photographing the area near San Lorenzo.
Can't we close and seal that opening with dynamite?
What kind of rifles were you using?
Are you afraid one of those bad people you sentenced will come after you?
I know it was a mean thing to do to tell on him that way.
- Come on, it's time for tea.
Do not fret.
My father and grandfather before me.
Hello, Ada.
Mmm, ain't it a place to like?
Well, now, I couldn't very well announce myself underwater, could I?
- Are you all right?
I don't think it matters much anymore, Hank.
The journal ends there.

What can the enemy be plotting, with nary a torch?

Yes.

Time for refreshment.
They are good.
She has a wonderful command of the idiom.
Old boy!
He's certainly not gonna live to be a very old bullfighter.
- Wait!
Just pay him and he will take care of everything.
Right in here, sir.
You must be joking.
Stage name, Cherie Chi Chi.
[AUDIENCE MURMURING]
You don't want to pay?
Jo?
If I would have known before, we could have discussed it.
What happened?
You look so pale
It was a close call.
Good night.
Go on...
Your clerk.
Is your father here?
- Why should I?
Bill, I never expected you, I thought...
- What conditions?
Well, what did you wanna...
When I walked in he was with his pal Sylvio.
The check.
Now, why did you do it?
Give up, Kyle.
Just sandwiches.
I wonder how they found that out.
Thank you.
- Uh, Eddie?
Sorry I couldn't make it, Vic, but thanks anyway.
Uh...
It's 24 past.
That's all.
No.
So, if that's all...
Your looks are laughable
Every hokey dame is the same I got a future a rosy future
Would you like me to scrub your back?
I want a bourbon, straight.
Something he picked up from me.
I couldn't let you throw away that money on me.
They have a sense of humour.
She was in show business.
O-R-F.
Okay, it's lunchtime.
- No sand dabs, huh?
You won't find anything out there except a hot grave.
I wonder if he can hear me.
- It'll help me.
Step back?
Holdups... three and four a week.
Who could I turn to?
And I once arrested a lieutenant governor.
No, sir.
Don't apologize.
Yes, after all, we have been authorized to build the marine drive.
Enough to send an agent to Spain to get it.
He's needed you, Ted.
714, this is Calgary Radio.
- oh, yes, certainly.
Hey, don't be offended!
He won't catch me!
- Poor Santamaria!
Hands off!
At once?
Good health!
I lov e you too so much.
But it's not as if that'll change the situation.
Date for what?
[Chuckles] On the shores of Gitchee Gumee.
Uh, w...
- I have to give it to somebody else.
- Moral:
- You're left-handed.
A tease, huh?
Certainly, no trouble.
I don't know exactly who he is.
- She's changed her hair.
- [POUNDING ON DOOR]
Isn't money a lovely thing?
- That monster machine you created.

When the Minister sent me he did not say it was for a discussion of biology.
So that we can observe all his movements.

-Certainly not.
When will we have you married off?

So, a similar example from the Russo-Japanese war.

And then we'll wait.

Can't you see he's groggy?
I feel disgust whenever I think about him.
You wait here by waterfall.

I am sick of this war.

And now I look in the periscope and it gives me the distance and the speed.
Here's a toast to life and to laughter and song
But the sound will carry, Herr Kapitän.
-Not yet,Sir
This is her home.
But I've always loved you ..
But, it is best this way.
You got no right.

He's over yonder in the well.

Cover me.
Look Montana, I'm in command here.
Wanna say something sir?
- You remember last night?

It's like the chaos when the universe was born.
You gotta have confidence in me.
He's chasin ' Sadie up a tree
Where's she live?
She had had a career earlier, she had made films with Rossellini... small films, small roles with Fellini, but she had never--
It was people who couldn't stand the film who had begun to whistle.
I might not believe it myself tomorrow.
Look at the sweets you brought!
I'll show them a thing or two!
But what's the point?
Make up your mind!
Me?
What do you mean?
Why do you want to see him?
So long.
- Just don't let her in.
Is it my fault that women always look at me?
How much did you have in your purse?
- Your name's Oscar?
All right.
I'd like to talk with you a moment.
Fur?
Me, I'd have picked a grey one.
What pay...
I'll do that little thing.
I just wanted to find out what's going on.
Best news I got was when Lincoln was dead.
Take it from an old army scout.
Every tribe has a lot of bands.
I guess he's not the only frustrated Custer in the army.
Hop on.
- Now I remember.
There's too much work to do on the fourth shift.
- I'II wash the dishes.
All my life, I've had it.
How tall must he be?
Lon, no!
What's driving you, Lon?
You suppose anything's happened?
Where is he?
Taking the Yakut to happiness, hey-hey-hey-hey.
Thanks, but I'm in a hurry to meet someone.
He also pretended to be my fellow countryman.
Yes.
About your life before you met Shimaki.
Guillermo, how many daughters do I have?
- Not at all!
Do as you see fit.
Good evening, gentlemen.
She's just had an accident.
- There's no obstacle to her being here?
Requiem æternam dona eis, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis.
It's really lovely.
No, it isn't just that.
We've got to get out of here.
After tonight, sleep won't be as peaceful.

It is now 8:05.

I am very put out with you.

Promise me now.
From all the stuff they're bringing ashore...
You better keep it.
Tonight, i tell you.
- Suddenly it's awfully hot in here.
- Hey, Tom!
Write off or no write off, she'll be good for some spares.
Are you?
So long as he uses the short cut, it's not possible.
- Well, you ain't.
Well, my beliefs remains firm, Amantha.

You'll scar them up worse.
Come on, Manty.
Oh, I see what you mean.
Close the door.
Come on.
-Why do you think she does aÉÉ this?
PÉease make your change, É don't wanna bother--
Do É need to teÉÉ you?
Then we'll rehearse until you do it right.
-She is.
-I mustn't allow myself to be despondent.
Now, look, baby.
- Phone call, Mr. Mason.
I'll get everyone quiet.
One time they were going to fight a duel.
Only for speeding.
And free enterprise?
Of course you are.
Well, by God, get improved and have a good Sunday.
- Believe me, Wyatt...
You have no right to put yourselves above the safety of this town.
What?
Your reputation will follow you wherever you are.
Come in and get me.
And Wyatt's word was law
I didn't want that boy to be killed!
Or take the chance of losing you forever
I'm sorry.
I only wish it were under happier circumstances.
Tighter.
Well, then one evening, he came along.
Darling!
Good-bye, Father.
Not since you were an altar boy.
I told her I didn't know whether or not she'd be with us today.
Just a moment.
Yes.
- You've known quite a few, haven't you?
Yes, of course.
Merry Christmas.
Well, au revoir, dear Janou.
Please let me tell him.
Isn't that extraordinary?
- Oh, madame.
Got to get my coat.
Something mean that you could do
I wouldn't know, Gladys.
Well, do you think you can sell it?

They are always so lost in the world, or so it seems.
You made chumps out of all of us, you— you Yankee gangster.
I told Shannon to, but he said he didn't come over here to start a war.
Hello?
See that big cloud ahead?
You're not the only one.
(CHUCKLES) Don't worry.
I caught him just as he was coming in to land.
I don't...
I just wanted to tell you.
What?
- Any ideas?
- He was in New York all the time.
Marilla, will you get in here?
A, B, C and D. The first one wins six to one.
- Oh no!
He is trying to speak Greek.
Get out of it.
Grandma.
What shall we do?
Strike!
Rubbish!
- You understand?
Can I have a word?
Forget us.
- soon as they can get it.
Well, you're gonna have to care.
And I would never set myself up to judge anybody.
You remember me?
Mr. Fannon is a man who never fastens his seat belt.
Now I realize they weren't referring to him, but to this memorial of his.
- You're wrong.
This way, please.
No, but I have contacts.
I'll kill myself or they'll kill me, but they won't get me alive.
But we mustn't read too much into these things.
It's a long story involving our families.
Then you think they were chosen intentionally?
My aunt has a picture ofhim that she guards jealously.
Ichiro can go back to the same company, right?
I think Allison deserves a better chance than his partner got.
You better get away from there, Doc, before you get hurt.
I'm never without it.
Do I owe income taxes?
- Listen to me, sonny.
Hey, honey, guess what?
- You mean, he might not be able to sing?
It's just that she gets jealous of anybody at all that I spend my time with.
I'll wait no matter how long it takes.
What about college and Law School that you've always talked about?
-Can't you guess?
They're called ideas.
- Good night.
- How are you?
I mean, I think we should help each other.
Yes?
How long will your parents be away?
Kissed, yes.
I'm so sorry to have come in such a painful time.
If she's not crazy, then What she says is true.
Shut up!
It's the fever.
Go back!
Some might be careful.
You know, the devil has something here.
Let no arm be raised to defend him.
But I also know the deep shadows that light can cast.
I didn't know you had cyclones in England.
- Fine.
He still is.
The other day you said you were going to the dentist.
Why do you think he sent you here?
Don't you remember, Ralph?
You shouldn't tell people anything until you're sure.
The simple basic fundamental biological law must be your weakness.
One foot there.
- At the bridge club.
- Red roses?
Cross your fingers.

- Get me my lawyer.
Only dishonest thing about "Curly" Fuller is the way he combs his hair.
No.
The general's been talking to Fuller.
I don't know if you remember.
We found the revolver in the alley, one bullet fired.
It wasn't signed.
Walter, could I call you back?
A long time ago.
It wasn't in my interests for it to fail, was it?
20% for you, 20% for Denis...
The butcher the baker and the friendly undertaker.
-Thank you.
-Hello.
Are you good at it?
What is it?
How do you do, Miss Hathaway?
Come on into the heat!
What's your problem?
I've already told myself that, but I haven't been able to convince myself.
A year in one town then in another.
To the moon?
I'll turn into a viper!
- Come here!
What are you hanging around for — to torture us?
Well, not something we can grab and run away with... but certainly pregnable.
- If we wait any longer, they'll get us too.
I can always tell when he's had a few.
- Well, tell him thanks.
You and Ferol take your coats off.
It's all yours.
Just as a child wants his father to be firm, troops crave discipline.
No.
You will apologise at once, or else you'll be placed under arrest!
- I didn't act like a coward!
How can you understand that and allow these men to be shot?
I can hardly get him behind a desk long enough to sign an order.
Roget!
Grant courage to this man who is about to die.
No, Major, that spirit was just born in them.
You've got yourself in a worse one.
Secure prisoners!
The lane through our Wire's in front here.
- There were machine-gun bullets...
I've been rude to my guests too long.
With all respect, sir, you have no right to order me to shoot down my own men... unless you are willing to take full and undivided responsibility for it.
Dismissed!
- Always a pleasure to see you, Colonel.
We don't want to slaughter the French army.
That's all, Colonel.
Ls everything all right, soldier?
- You wanted to see me, sir.
Corporal Paris and Private Lejeune reporting, sir.
It's impossible, sir.
- I'll have to ask you for an advance of 30 crowns, and I'll get you a dog, that will make everybody's head turn round.
- Look here, friend, give me some advise,
I don't understand a single word!
- Kotatko - deaf and dumb.
Aside from its purchasing power, it's completely useless as far as I'm concerned.
Uh, what did you say?
You make the arrest.
I'll figure it as my fault.
I've got to talk to you.
Not razor sharp, but sharp enough.
You are a big help.
Any station.
You've seen that in all her publicity.
Oh, but it's wonderful to be in love, and it's even more wonderful to be on a TV show without any commercials.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, Jenny!
I behaved childishly in the corridor.
I wanted to raise chickens once, like Old MacDonald.

Oldest eternal daughter... though you're the lamb she'll slaughter... twil be... a lively... death.
Make it good.
You'd have seen the same thing in - in Benson... or Huachuca.
You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that.
Let's, uh, run it up the flagpole and see if anyone salutes it.
I want to ask you something.
- A pretty good guess.
Not guilty.
- "This isn't a game"?
Mrs. Bainbridge.
I don't see what all this stuff about the knife's got to do with anything.
Yeah, huh?
No, I don't.
Wherever you run into it, prejudice always obscures the truth.
Work your heart out.
But you can't prove it!
What it must feel like to want to pull the switch.
You think too much.
What else do you want?
Thank you.
Anybody says it like that, they mean it!
Real drive.
This sensitivity I can understand.
It's not important.
Number eight?
Hey, what is it with this fan here?
I'll make myself about six or seven inches shorter.
You know what I mean?
Why should he lie?
You're letting him slip through our fingers.
I just paced off 12 feet across the room.
Yeah, let's
You know, you do-gooders are all alike.
I heard a good story last night...
There's enough doubt to wonder if he was there at all at the time of the killing.
Stop.
Do you wear glasses when you go to bed?
I mean, maybe you can still smell it on me.
- He's 18 years old.
Who was in The Amazing Mrs Bainbridge?
Oh, this is a very fine boy.
There were six cars on the train.
Come on.
No one wears eyeglasses to bed.
You can't send someone off to die on evidence like that.
That's all.
Ah, look.
Those two chairs are the old man's bed.
- You heard me.
Well, nobody's blaming them for it.
I just wish you"d be more confident.
Don't pin everything on us!
And this?
- I took Evelyne home.
Hector doesnt't feel well.
Ah, I understand!
-But, darling...
at least not with you!

Wait for me, honey, let's have breakfast together, and we can talk.
Were you involved in all the big events?
Just find him for me
The radiation dormant in the monster must have set off a chain reaction.
Good.
Well, who's afraid of the local medicine man?
Terry!
Can I clean your boots?
- Professor!
I told you that.
- Here.
ARE ALL THE MEN GATHERED?
-You already told that.
Objection.
I'll even recommend you as a fortuneteller, but right now I'm on my way to Bridgetown.
And you taught him so well that he wound up exactly where you wanted him.
Sit down!
I'll get someone to solve this mystery.
No secrets resisted me.
There always was some kind of incommunicability between us, imagine Rodolfo spoke 7 languages, but was still a taciturn.
- O my God, what happened?
- The widow?
Well, you must come to Tufello with me and explain everything to Fernando.
- And who are you?
You love Bianca.
- You'll pay the damages?
Can you understand that?
I've asked you, begged you, but nothing helps.
Have you got any schnapps?
- And we actually milked some milk.
- They'll think and be more frightened.
Death stands behind you.
I got angry, believe me.
He sings so sweetly of Jesus Christ

But not for him.

Detective JANG.
Take a closer look.
Fleury, Maxwell Fleury.
It was the first on the island.
Mr. Fleury.
- I will try to speak to you with words that come from my heart.
It doesn't have a name, really.
Excuse me.
He wouldn't want to hurt his wife.
After all, it's protocol.
Bit of luck your wife ran into me.
Get the point?
Fair?
- It's a comfort.
Come on.
Oh, just measuring you.
Now, listen to me.
What are you getting at, Pete?
We don't have the right kind of love for each other.
- You are an impressionable man, Mr. McNee.
- Insecticide?
The unbelievably small and the unbelievably vast eventually meet, like the closing of a gigantic circle.
Oh, the draft board, the Navy, a life insurance physical.
- Mm-hm.
We've won that much.
- But you're so much better now.
What's the weight?
And everyday I became more tyrannical, more monstrous in my domination of Louise.
Here she is. 36-and-a-half inches of feminine pulchritude.
- You mean like a cancer?

There he is, Professor Moriarty.
While I was wondering about the book they had stolen... the Rosetta Stone incident happened.
I, Professor Moriarty, will take action tonight!
I can imagine Inspector Lestrade must be very eager to find them now.
Could this be Professor Moriarty again?
Professor Moriarty's new weapon saved us.
I finally found it!
Professor Moriarty got angry and threw it.
Inspector Lestrade is here.
Mrs. Hudson, please call Inspector Lestrade.
We give flowers to the soul of our worthy opponent, Mr. Sherlock Holmes.
I'm Inspector Lestrade from Scotland Yard.

Professor Moriarty!
Inspector Lestrade has failed.
Please inform Inspector Lestrade.
Inspector Lestrade and his police force have arrived.
Professor Moriarty!
In fact, Professor Moriarty has done exactly that... or so he thought.
Inspector Lestrade.
In the newspaper, Inspector Lestrade declared that the case was simple... but he still hasn't found any clues.
Yes, Inspector Lestrade ordered us to leave them.
Inspector Lestrade experimented with ways to carry out the gold bullion.
Did Inspector Lestrade investigate this room?
No, Inspector Lestrade's investigation was for the most part outside.

Inspector Lestrade, I have no intention of disturbing you.
Oh, Inspector Lestrade.
I appreciate that Inspector Lestrade.
Inspector Lestrade is in a big jam.
This must be the work of Professor Moriarty.
My name is Sherlock Holmes.
To complicate matters further there's to be a showdown on the Thames River between Holmes and his arch rival, Professor Moriarty!
Professor Moriarty.
Professor Moriarty took advantage of the chaos... and stole the blue ruby, the only one of it's kind in the world.
Thank you for coming, Inspector Lestrade.
But when I spoke to Inspector Lestrade, he said...
We'll probably need the help of Inspector Lestrade.
I am Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard.
I'll just tell him that Inspector Lestrade's deduction was correct.
Sherlock Holmes.
I'm Sherlock Holmes.

Where is Inspector Lestrade?
When you said "them", you meant Professor Moriarty, right?
Never think that Professor Moriarty can be beaten like this.
So long, Inspector Lestrade!
Brother!
The cunning Professor Moriarty aims to win the air race... by using the stolen engine.
As long as Sherlock Holmes is here no criminal can commit any crime in this big city.
Even Professor Moriarty?

Can you tell Inspector Lestrade... to have the ship leave in five minutes.

Considering Inspector Lestrade was test driving this time... he must be really angry.
Mr. Focus, that is Professor Moriarty.
I am Sherlock Holmes.
I believe that this scrap of cloth is from the cloak of Professor Moriarty.

I wished I could have asked Professor Moriarty how he liked the dessert.

No, no, no.
I thought I remembered Jane telling me once... that you flew to Dallas together...
I never even told Walt or Hunter.
Well, Trav... think maybe you're ready to... tell me what the hell happened to you over the last four years?
He has to sleep somewhere.
Yeah.
Looks like a girl's car to me.
It costs him a little to get him out.
It was floating around.
I think you'll maybe want to talk to one of the other girls.
He had this idea...
Can you tell?
His arms were burning.
- Why?
What size shoes do you wear?
So do I.
This is a bank?
I can't see you Jane.
You mind telling me where you're headed, Trav?
What?
Thought maybe you might like to see some of them.
Clean up.
Come on!
You showed me I was.
Well, Travis went to meet you at school,

Wouldn't you even be tempted to try on somebody else's existence for a day?
- Babboo, I'm home.
Everywhere.
One of those guys you look back on and you go Oh, my God, what was I thinkin'?
That's a gain of 18 points.
Oh, Rom!
I thought Chief O'Brien trapped the last vole on the station months ago.
I'm not going to reverse the FCA's decision.
You mean... equal rights for females?
Where the hell did he put the marketing report?
We've got a lot of work to do.
The whole town's under surveillance.
People come and go.
Careful.
Where is she?
Where?
There's four of 'em.
I didn't even see you.
I love my wife.
They're ready for church.
- Oh, yes!
Am I right here this evening?
I tried quite a few times, and there's no answer.
- Get some good publicity.
- You'll get the same thing again, won't you?
Glory to God.
Jesus!
This is just part of our responsibility.
Did I tell you to hang around and chat?
Now Shane here, on the other hand, well, that's a whole different story, see?
Hey, honey.
Look here, son.
- Help me get him in the bed.
The word maa in Mandarin in the different tones,
You weren't seen?
- Londo...
I'm in position.
you'll find him in Moscow.
he has.
Right here.
Yes, she said MiGs.
You can finish it on the plane.
- That's what I keep telling them.
He's a very good negotiator.
Listen to me.
So you know everyone on the plane?
President.
Then I kill them.
- Five.
This is Marshall.
We gotta get her slowed down now.
- And the snow coming in.
Please!
She traced it back to the White House satellite account.
NdeR M@nkÖÖ
Okay, I got it.
But thanks to the support of one of the world's greatest leaders...
So will the next president.
Sir, this plane carries the president of the United States, although we—
- Yes, sir.
We need options.
Joe, over here in front of me.
Oh, Gus!
- Not lately, though.
- that's the three-dimensional sonar.
- What?
- I KNOW YOU'LL LOVE THAT.
- A KNIFE?
I'm glad y'all didn't buy a bridge from that gentleman.
- What do you mean?
- The little guy.
- It's tough.
- Yeah, that's a strawberry grouper.
Can I help y'all?
Gus!
Yeah, we can rent one.
I'm sorry.
- You know that's Catch.
No, they dont wanna cooperate.
His operation would make him a much diminished man.
He wanted me to have the transplant more than I did.
I don't know what to do.
I will not cooperate any further.
Now, I know you feel that they've won but as long as you don't break inside, they can't win.
Oh, right.
Yeah, but we have a serious problem.
These images are graphical representation of the basic elements:
That sound familiar.
Yes.
I beg you.
I sounded pretty smart, huh?
What you doin', peddling this gold-can jive?
- l'm on it.
- I see you still kiting around with the large size ladies.
- You know, this guy's a real tornado.
- Good day.
Only in its strategies.
(speaking in foreign language)
- No, what?
Insult the man who holds your destiny between his fingers.
- You go to hell!
Present from Bumpy.
That stock exchange figure they used for the numbers was 579 last week!
- We right with you, Bumpy.
That's one more than I'll take!

That's the problem.
Enough of those loads your love load is sufficient
Ok ok ok come on girls.
I saw this camera beneath your bed.
REALLY?
Thank His Majesty for his kindness
Yeah, bring it on.
Yes.
No.
They think I'm BooBoo the Fool.
Agent Chance, when did they remove you from Kyle's detail?
I don't give a shit!
Think we should strike the North Koreans.
He didn't assign me one.
No semen...
Craig Nisker and Associates?
I just can't believe this.
Take it easy this evening, huh?
Oh, hi, girls!
Phillip, amazing facts!
Joe!
- Come on.
So you've unlocked something very precious, have you?
Yes, Francie?
- She's right down here.
- I said stop right there!
you have your weapon ?
It seems that they need Emily to continue the tests.
HE SAID EMILY WAS IN HIS CARE,
I...
What can you do?
Where in the kitchen?
I wanna talk to you about the discipline committee.
I'll kill you--
Maybe I can't prove it, but he fucked up Cesar and killed Benny!
Rita.
I've got all this stuff I have to put into the computer.
Yes.
In time, all of you will be hurt if they're not stopped.
You know, out back.
- You all right, Grampa?
- [Grampa] Oh, quit your bellyaching, you big loser!
The one thing that we knew we had to do was create this cartouche that showed there were hundreds of Stargates out there.
Sam belongs to the network, okay?
What's going on?
No way they'll let you do another interview .
But I didn't mean to hurt anybody.
I don`t.
They`re forcing you to do something drastic.
No, no hearing problem.
Why didn't you take the camera if you're going to be so humane?
-Go ahead.
- Thanks.
I don't think you have anything to worry about, Mr. O'Brien.
Calling control, the maniac is now going towards staircase B.
No further questions.
Well...
It's going to be great.
Channel 6 says yes.
[Man Narrating] Dateline, Springfield.
I saw lights on...
- ah, you got me mixed up with something from the movies.
I meet a lot of nice people.
Hey.
It's numb.
Th-that's what the man does to people when they disrespect him.
Here's the gun.
AND TAKE YOUR PLACE FOR A WHILE ?
- I DIDN'T HEAR IT THAT TIME.
IF YOU GET THE GODDAMN STORY STRAIGHT,
WELL, THAT'S HOW I FELT.
- Okay !
- I'm gonna blow your friend's head off.
- Hey, Mr. Barret.
- shit!
Who cut his fucking finger off?
Where is it?
No, I'll meet you at the site.
Killer Minister of the Interior Kali escaped from prison.
Thanks, but we already have a doorstop.
So many people come and go, I didn't know.
I'm just babbling.
What a mess.
Let's see.
- You don't need this.
Further upstage, way, way upstage.
Get rid of those chairs, will you?
I believe that's marked in the score.
Have a good time.
- Thank you for your genius.
- What's happening?
Never lose control.
Coming out of there... you were already in the restroom...

Thanks.
Yeah!

It's unlikely they understood it.
All power sources on core induction bus.
I have to keep talking.
Glad you could make it, David.
Mr. President.
You're wasting my tax dollars!
Why?
David, explain this to me, please.
Ellie, did I miss something?
I'll try to keep recording!
Come on, hurry up, Dad!
A couple guys wanted to build something called an airplane.
Now, I'm going to recommend that Dr. Drumlin coordinate the decryption effort.

I don't want excuses.
We've got video on Ellie.

I'm really confused.
Like all discoveries this one will continue to be reviewed examined and scrutinized.
One Nobel Prize winner noted, his words:
Security problem!
It's coming from the bottom.
How is that new office?
This Machine if it works, and you travel to Vega at the speed of light when you come back...
Right?
Would you consider yourself a spiritual person?
Does it show?
Want the new data?
It could be a weapon.
Every time they detect a new civilization they fax construction plans from space.
All systems ready for drop sequence.
We're in 45%.
You'd need a satellite to transmit it, but it would be impossible to...
You could be marooned, unable to return.
They all travel here through that transit system you built?
What happens now?
-Go.
The IPV dropped straight through.
It's true, you pulled the plug?
Science fiction.
How you doing?
It might be some type of advanced communication device, or a teaching machine of some kind.
Dad.
Excuse me, Dr. Drumlin, sir?
STEVE:
Then why don't you simply withdraw your testimony and concede that this journey to the center of the galaxy never took place?
No.
Told you.
Richard Rank, head of the Conservative Coalition.
They will actively participate on-site, during the construction process.
Senator, I believe that the Machine opened up a wormhole a tunnel through space-time, also known as an Einstein-Rossen Bridge.

Hello.
It's better that way
Alpha, Bravo, Charlie.
We're cooked.
80%.
I flipped through it.
That he engineered this?
Over half a trillion dollars were spent.
No!
What you don't know is, I agree.
Are you going to sit there and tell us we should just take this all on faith?
The usual.
We're all impressed with your candor and your stamina.
As soon as I found out about it, I called the President.
I've done it before.
You're not real.

CRUSOE:
Perhaps.
[Gasps and grunts]
That's it.

I respected Garry more than any man I've ever known.
William Garry murdered his wife and children.

DOCTOR, IS THE BOY BILLY STILL HERE?
That's what he calls me.
Hello!
- He's the ugly man.
Hey, Brad.
Protomatter's one of the most sought- after commodities.
We will adapt.
We don't. I've designed a monitor for Neelix to wear that will alert us at the first sign of necrosis and we'll continue with the daily injections.
It was necessary to repair the necrotized tissue.
I should remember something!
- Where's my daughter?
Hmm.
Oh , it is a little slut, isn't it?
Come on , pull!
-Good-bye, Wallace.
- Put the Degas in the bedroom.
Back and back.
Thank you.
Hey, who thought of the name Titanic?
But I thought, tonight.
- All the right ones, of course.
She's splendid.
They were quite charming.
Bugger me!
It's all right, miss.
- All the way down here.
Outwardly , I was everything a well-brought-up girl should be.
She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached but not five-- not five.
I couldn't go , Jack.
Rose and I differ in our definition of fine art.
You're my little sailor.
She's kind of old.
It would hurt.
You stand back!
( Chuckles)
I'm your fiancée.
Fire and foe,...
Turn !
For the time being I shall require only women and children.
- Rose !
- Sir, you're not supposed to be in here.
Rose, they put it in my pocket.
I understand.
I know.
Do you want to hear this or not, Mr. Lovett?
Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course.
I'll have the salmon.
Hold on.
No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.
No, mate.
No, you won't.
All right?
You're being very rude.
All right!
Lower away!
Hurry up, give him a hand!
Is my destino.

We need help!
Don't you say your goodbyes.
First-class dogs come down here to take a shite.
No, you won't.
That's right.
My God.
- Right.
Water... 1 4 feet above the keel in ten minutes--
Come on , Ruth , get in the boat.
All right, you have my attention, Rose.
Sounds like you're a good man to have around in a sticky spot.
Tell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson.
You're not to see that boy again.
Come on, come on, come on
Hello?
Pull.
No matter how hopeless.
What do you see?
Practically goddamn royalty, ragazzo mio !
Almost.
- Can you shore up?
- He couldn't have.
- That's the bedroom door!
If only you'd come to me sooner.
Wearing only this.
You'll be killed.
Shall we go dress, Mother?
Dawson.
So, now there's talk of an iceberg.
- Make your turn.
That's typical.
That's all that I want.
- Hard over.
- No, stop!
Brock:
Go on!
- Steward:
Crewman:
- Give me my hands, man.
I'll take more of that.
Come on!
Good of you to come.
It's flooded eight feet and the mail hold is worse.
We're rolling.
I got it.
Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch.
So, it's all's well and back to our brandy?
Okay, drop down, and go into the first-class gangway door.
- No, stop!
- I see it.
Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic when she was 17, right?
We'll ride horses on the beach, in the surf.
I was here last night, remember?
That's all I want.
Amen.
Okay, go.
You know, it's a pity I didn't keep that drawing.
We have to move!
- Sorry, Trudy.
- I just need to speak to someone.
Get rid of that!
It's stuck!
- Hi.
I'm interested in the untold stories, the secrets deep inside the hull.

You think you're big, tough men ?
Yeah, roger that
That's the bedroom door.
Hang on a second.
So this is the ship they say is unsinkable.

There's no, uh-- There's no arrangement, is there?
- One !
Mr Andrews...
There's yourfirst clue, Sherlock.
- ( Growls)
- All the way down here.
All ahead full.
Cal, stop.
- Any more women and children?
I can't do this.
Pull her in!
Sir, they need you in the second-class purser's office.
Now I know I'm in first class!
It will ensure our survival.
I was just here last night, you don't remember me?
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death-
None of the stewards have seen her.

(Cal) So good to see you.
Yes, get on the boat, Rose.
Wait, wait, wait.
Oh, yes.
Bye Carole, see you tomorrow.
Yeah, you do.
I heard about your mishap.
-What did you do?
What do I have to be grateful for?
I'll write you a check, Dad.
I'm not going to hurt you.
Didn't know I was for sale.
You jam it into the door, and then you arm it right here.
This guy right here, JB.
is that it?
So she told me to get out.
Does she care that Robert is sensitive?
I don't see any that aren't broken.
And I just talked to the Joint Chiefs.
I have just received word, that the Asgard have arrived.

Were these things also found in the ruins?
Can you tell me why you stopped me from killing Anubis the last time I was ascended?
Don't say that.
You don't know what he is.
It's okay.
That's a flammables carrier, Dave!
- Oh.
I know you do.
- [Sighs]
No one touches that money!
- I did.
Why?
Good...
Everyone will be a Communist by the end of the century.
Don't do it.
You have met?
I wondered if this was the moment he'd been waiting for.
Law without compassion the curse of the poor.
Do you watch "The Young?" -"The Young?"
You want the sword?
I'm not staying.
All right.

You want to get married?
What does "help" mean?
What sun, what scenery, what greenery!
Hit it!
I told you I was here.
What do you think?
Please don't go!
A little crystal and such... whatever your flavor is.
And plus, you know, I got some things I gotta figure out.
What?
I don't remember.
What do we do?

Had a little party, did you?
My kid used to do that when he was little.
- Come on!
Come on!
But these wormholes we go through,... ..they're not always there, right?

Would it matter that you might be saving a human life?
Coming through!

Okay.
No.
Go!

I mean run, now.
Well, the only way he can make the kill and escape is from a distance.

Just spotted a conspicuous white male.
It belongs to the world, but for the moment it's mine alone.
Her mother brought her to me when she was nine.

I mean, why would Feeny feel the need to attack what I believe in?
Big and loud
It just takes longer now.
Oh, now he'll never get back into a romantic mood.
There'd come a day when the illusion I created would vanish.
You just don't know what it's like to be so much in love that you cry all night.
The girl's coming up the path.
I'll see that she doesn't !
What good is it to insult me ?
Come on, young man.
I can see that Mrs. Pierce is moving towards the bow.
Yeah.
We better put this away.
Oh, thanks.

Anybody else starts throwing slugs at you, doc, don´t forget to duck.
Much trouble.
Take me for instance, kid.
Hardly.
Thank you.
Some joke, eh?
Don't you find, Mr. Leland, that the United States is inclined to forget that most of the world is at war already with more war to come, perhaps in the pacific?
- Bellboy, señor.
The Crossley rating doesn't agree, Heller.
The way I feel right now, I could devise a murder... that would baffle even Sherlock Holmes.
Take your time.

Who's there?
But you came too soon.
Your wife, huh?
Give me, I pray thee,..

What's your course?
Don't argue!

-Come on.
Let's go in here, shall we?
Every book's got a number.
Oh, what did I do?
It'll have to go, Ruby.
-Why?
Lots of girls get married when they're 18.
- Paul.
I told Taylor that he was ruining my political career.
Most of them come from a reform school.
Get a load of that.
All right.
I don't know.
I get along very well with Paul because he's on the dead up-and-up.
BUT
Well, don't be upset, Jim dear.

Certainly, Highness, but humans don't grow as reliably as trees.
For example... [clears throat] ...you're walking along, minding your own business, you're looking neither to the left nor to the right, when all of a sudden... you run smack into a pretty face.
[Faline] Bambi!
What's going on around here?
That I'm looking for romance
Right on the big dog's head.
Did the young prince fall down?
Flower.
For I'm seeking romance
We will drink to our betrothal.
I am neither afraid of Kamar nor any man that lives.
Come!
We are your friends.
I'm strictly big time.
That is it.
Just dance away from him.
- Three weeks.
- You two are the funniest couple.
Huh?
Hey, judge!
Do you mean Peter Jackson himself?
All except one, Mr. Sullivan.
- I saw him fight Sullivan.
I guess so.
I got plenty of time.
Go on.
Get out of here, you dog.
Caution!
Your father achieved that, splendid Mr. Jobst.
That is modern.
She made it far, this Mrs. Tandler.
You're that far already with the farmer?
Why don't you just say, "I love you, Emily"?
Hank?
No, don't bother, I know it all.
You couldn't have.
But I'm no brainstorm.
And that's how we'll lick the Axis.
A little after dawn.
Then...
Oh yes, they told me that she was pale and blonde with big blue eyes!
"Dear Lord, of power and of glory, who gives us rainbows in our skies..."
You may damn excuse, I haven,t tried that before.
These things don't happen in northern Italy!
- Thanks.
And then they wonder why I only had two children.
It's chipped, but clean.
Sherlock Holmes, I suppose you think that he's Leopold Dilg with a beard, huh?
I have loved it for years, especially with an egg in it.
Your gentlemen friend is dead, isn't he?
They're after your scalp.
You get upstairs.
Some of the best examples of early American architecture in New England.
Sherlock Holmes, I suppose you think that he's Leopold Dilg with a beard, huh?
- The prettiest woman in Lochester.
Sherlock Holmes, you think that he's Leopold Dilg with a beard, huh?
They wore beards.
Sherlock Holmes, you think that he's Leopold Dilg with a beard, huh?
For 15 years, sir... 15 years.
I wonder if I can say this as I want to.
I mean I never knew who they were.
I told you I wouldn't have it with me.
- It will stop all crime.
WELL, BLESS MY SOUL.
WHAT YOU DO IF WITZEL FIND OUT TONDELAYO BACK?
PLEASE REMEMBER YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF.
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.
ARE YOU CRAZY, TOO?
TONDELAYO LIKE MUSIC.
ELLEN:
Are you nuts?
I had you mixed up.
Run!
I'm so glad to see you both.
We'll set it for then.
But I gathered Mr. Craig doesn't share your sympathy for children.
- The Athletics and the Yanks.
- No, to take me to the airport, silly.
- Sure you want me?
- Sam.
It's a fine hat.
Oh yeah?
I didn't mean that literally.
We've got an hour's extra petrol.
I found five soldiers.
- Forbes?
The ballpark will be crowded, and the fans will give you an automobile.
All the things we've never had time for before.
We've been married 10 minutes.
Here he is now, the pride of the ballroom.
- You're trying to be funny, too?
But I'm gonna be an engineer.
- You'll excuse me, I'm sure, Miss Beldon.
You see that German plane come down?
- Clem!
- Well, I...
Not me, Horace.
- Yes, it makes you look rather ridiculous.
MAN:
I just wondered if you had a nice time in town, that was all.
Every day while I'm around.
I shouldn't have asked you.
- I'll be very glad to see.
'Tis said, as Cupid danced among the gods, he down the nectar flung which on the white rose being shed, made it forever after red.
Thank your father too, darling.
He may be killed any day, any hour.
Not only for real flying but real...

-That's all.
Not me, Horace.
-Vin!
Yes, dear.
They are going for the aerodrome again.
-Yes.
Hurry.
Come along.
I have killed Shere Khan.
The memsahib refers to the storyteller?
He looks in the river, he sees the fish he wants, then who.
Harder.
He speaks german quite well.
Close the door, please.
Get out of the way there, make room for Sir Henry.
The night is fair!
What are you moping about?
In the name of The King of Naples, I order you to open the door!
He looked about eight feet to me.
- He's dead.
- A private investigator.
- The villagers are getting out of hand.
I'll write as soon as I get to Tokyo
That's all.
- Thank you.
She's gonna dance with the guy what brung her.
But this is something that'll benefit all humanity.
How can you close me up?
He needed me.
I have my orders.
You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced.
Capt. Renault, I am under your authority.
-You finish locking up, will you?
-Don't tell me.
For accessory to the murder of the couriers from whom these were stolen.
Yes.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
It's been a long time.
And don't forget, there's a price on your head.
No.
-I didn't count the days.
I was misinformed.
You understand how I feel.
I don't like disturbances in my place, so either lay off politics or get out.
-I reserved a table.
Germans will be here pretty soon and they'll come looking for you.
Serves me right for asking a direct question.
To the Germans, that last will be just a minor annoyance.
- You know where they are?
I can't do it again.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
-l wonder if you do.
Well, drinking!
Oh, too bad.
All that he's been living for.
My car, quickly!
- All except one thing.
- Yes.
I'm not.
You'll still win at roulette.
But you were able to arrange everything?
Perhaps tomorrow we'll be on the plane.
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.
If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
This is a pleasure I have looked forward to.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Ask Monsieur Rick.
In 1935, you ran guns to Ethiopia.
But then I never was much of a businessman.
We hear very little, and we understand even less.
Come, Mr. Laszlo, I will help you immediately.
I can't find her.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa.
How much I still love you.
Then by train or auto or foot across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco.
- Fine, but I'd like to buy your café.
Naturally, there will be a few incidental expenses.
Shut up and go home, will you?
They'll find out your record.
I'm sure in a little while--
And if it should change?
For the last time, put them on the table.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
- Don't listen to him.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Mr. Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you.
That was his way of protecting me.
Don't bother to deny it.
Well, you are in pretty good shape, Herr Rick.
You carry your love of country like a flag, right out in the open.
If you think I'd put any of my wife's money into that trash, you're crazy.
You'll have the audience standing with excitement.
- Well, think we should?
- Goodbye.
Mother and Josie threw out handbills.
It's a wonderful feeling having your name written in music.
Thank heavens, it's like a thousand miles from all the noisy, neurotic people in our profession.
Gee, I never cared much for my name before.
Do you really?
- Thanks, kid.
- Good evening.
- Don't do that!
I mean for Mr. George M. Cohan.
I feel as though I've known you for years.
- What?
Oh, buried.
If you haven't time now, maybe you'll give us time after the show?
Like it?
Oh, they'll all have to be destroyed.
- No.
I'm too tired to argue.
You could stay here and live off what's left of the fat of the land.
I have vouched for you.
-Look at your meter.
Over here.
No.
Oh, hush.
It's wonderful, Pressure.
Extra.
Hey, Pressure.
You men have discharged your debt to the state and are going back into the world free men.

Quite a shock, wasn't it?
What are those bags over there?

She's a woman!

You stop that, you!
- But I'll tell you something in confidence...
I see.
Those who were still living had forgotten all about it.
- That's it!
I think, sir, that I'd better leave immediately.
If you knew who you're talking to.
He was peacefully crossing the courtyard and the guards killed him with an arrow... just for fun.
I know where.

Can you tell me if you had to make a choice, if you were forced to choose between imagining her out there somewhere living a good life, being happy but you don`t know you never find out or the worst being true her being gone but you know.
I don`t endorse it.
Did you get hard?
WAIT A MINUTE.
JUST LET HIM GO.

Sherlock Holmes VASILIY LIVANOV
Inspector Lestrade BORISLAV BRONDUKOV
To Mr. Sherlock Holmes esquire.
- Her name is Irene Adler.
I thought Irene Adler would only stay in the folder, named "The Scandal in Bohemia."
You faltered, Sherlock Holmes.
It was not that you felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
Of course, Irene Adler was an exception, which proves the rule.
And what about Irene Adler?
Irene Adler was a good lesson for both of us.
This is Mr. Sherlock Holmes, and this Dr. Watson.
Not Mr. Sherlock Holmes!
Do not be upset, Miss Morsten, Sherlock Holmes, my friend will solve this case.
Mr. Sherlock Holmes --

"My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
- Irene Adler is married.
To Mr. Sherlock Holmes esquire.
Scotland Yard inspector Lestrade, who arrested everyone in the house except Sherlock Holmes, and Thaddeus Sholto was brought to trial on a charge of murder of his brother.
It was Sherlock Holmes, your humble servant and this dog, who, by the way, brought us to a large timber-yard.
- Mr. Sherlock Holmes has gone out?
But Sherlock Holmes is a detective too.
- Mr. Sherlock Holmes is out.
Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?
No, no, not to me but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
I don't need that.
I'm sorry, I'm just babbling.
- Shut the fuck up, bitch!
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
Yes... about you and me... and Jack... and the gold.
-"There's no more of me to see."
The abyss.
- What do you want?
I'd like to know whether there was a relationship between the two of you.
You expect me to wait here on my own?
Are you a fool?
I didn't realise you were carrying such a torch for me.
Check out!
You should wear the clothes.
Not a sound.
It was an unfortunate choice.
The girls like it.
But, uh, I thought it'll be good for us.
Right, yeah.
Do you know there's a professor at Manchester who sets his students the task of tracing your sources.
You are an asshole.
Let's help you.
Our Juma?
He got killed in the Orient trying to rescue a nun.

Let's see if he will come.
Yes.

Why would He want to see me?
Punch in to some Rinky-dink outfit
Thank you.
Sure, superman.
I'll show you a few tricks of my own.
I don't want to be stressed by this one.
Have a seat.
Rose... rose spray!
Even if the body is, you still can see the clothes!
Luckily I am miles away.
How can that be in a place where no one can read?
- No, I didn't.

Maybe it's me, Butler.
Help!
I've been like this.

So here we are with Find the Fish.
Is God really real
Well, no, but I can go down the road anytime I want and walk into Harry's and hold my head up high and say, in a loud, steady voice,
