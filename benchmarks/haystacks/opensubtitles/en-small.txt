Now you can tell 'em.
What for are you mixing in?
Maybe I don't like to see kids get hurt.
Break any bones, son?
He's got a knife behind his collar!
- There's a stirrup.
You want a lift?
- No.
- Why not?
- I'm beholden to you, mister.
Couldn't we just leave it that way?
- Morning.
- Morning.
- Put him up?
- For how long?
- I wouldn't know.
- It'll be two bits for oats.
- Ain't I seen you before?
- Depends on where you've been.
- I follow the railroad, mostly.
- Could be you've seen me.
- It'll be four bits if he stays the night.
- Fair enough.
Morning.
Did a man ride in today - tall, sort of heavyset?
- You mean him, Mr Renner?
- Not him.
This one had a scar.
Along his cheek?
No, sir.
I don't see no man with a scar.
I guess maybe I can have some apple pie and coffee.
I guess you could have eggs with bacon if you wanted eggs with bacon.
- Hello, Charlie.
- Hello, Grant.
It's good to see you, Charlie.
It's awful good to see you.
It's good to see you too.
Doc you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes.
